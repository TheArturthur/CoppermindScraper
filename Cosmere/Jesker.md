>“*Jesker teaches that only humans have the ability--or the curse--of being oblivious to the Dor*”
\-Galladon explaining to Raoden about the Dor[1]

**Jesker** is a religion practiced on [[Sel\|Sel]]. It is one of the oldest religions on Sel, and was effectively exterminated when the [[Duladel Republic\|Duladel Republic]] was overthrown by [[Hrathen\|Hrathen]]. Many call Jesker a 'primitive' religion, though saying this was considered offensive to its followers.
Jesker appears to involve spirits. The [[Dor\|Dor]] is referred to as the Jesker "overspirit". Jesker is said to look to the Dor and attempt to understand it. Followers of the Jesker religion strive to bring themselves in harmony with the Dor and subsequently with nature, and taught that everything knew of the Dor, except humans, who could be oblivious to it. Jesker also ascribed importance to the heaven's movements, and according to [[Hrathen\|Hrathen]], worshipped the moon.
The [[Jeskeri Mysteries\|Jeskeri Mysteries]] are a religious cult that was related to Jesker, but [[Galladon\|Galladon]] insists it is a mockery of true Jesker, who did not have any true understanding of the Dor.
The Jeskeri priests also teach that the [[Elantrian\|Elantrians]] are damned.
