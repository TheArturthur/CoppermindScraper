## Appearance & Personality
In his unembodied form, TheGannon is completely invisible to the living. To other poltergeists he appears as a glowing field seeping over surfaces. When in possession of a living body, he looks and sounds like the person he is possessing, including their accent and some of their mannerisms. In this state he can be recognized by other poltergeists as one of their kind due to a bright yellow-colored glow visible around his form.
TheGannon is relatively young, and is referred to as a "kid" by Icer. He is likely argumentative or frustrating to his fellow poltergeists.

## Attributes and Abilities
As a poltergeist, TheGannon must possess the body of a living person in order to maintain consciousness. When possessing a body, he gains full control over the person and can even access certain skills for a limited time. If the body he is possessing is killed, he is forcefully ejected and becomes a mindless, primal unembodied spirit, desperate for warmth until he finds and takes over a new body. He can also [[Bolting\|Bolt]] from one body to another if he makes physical contact with the new body.

## History
At some point, TheGannon was a living young man. He died at an unknown point and under unknown circumstances and became a poltergeist.
TheGannon met fellow poltergeists [[Dreamer (character)\|Dreamer]], [[Phi\|Phi]], [[Longshot\|Longshot]], [[Icer\|Icer]], and [[Rabies\|Rabies]], who also love to play games. As a group, they got together often to play games by possessing the living and using their bodies disposably, as if they were players inhabiting the persona of a video game character. During one such game, he was on a team with Dreamer, [[Longshot\|Longshot]], [[Icer\|Icer]], and [[Rabies\|Rabies]], attempting to stop [[Phi\|Phi]] before he could get to Longshot. TheGannon was assigned to guard the building where Longshot was hiding. At some point in the game, he and Longshot had an argument and he left. Phi didn't know he had left the game, so he was cautious on approaching Longshot's building. He was scheduled to have a footrace across the country with Phi after the game.

## Trivia
TheGannon's gamer handle is most likely a reference to the character  from *The Legend of Zelda* series of video games.
