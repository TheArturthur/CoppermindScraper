**Tatara** is [[Llarimar\|Llarimar's]] daughter and [[Lightsong\|Lightsong's]] favorite niece. She is saved by Lightsong after falling into the ocean while sailing.

## Appearance
Tatara has a youthful face with brown hair and dark tan skin. [[Lightsong\|Lightsong]] poetically describes her red lips as being "three shades shy of the seventh harmonic, with a deep beauty."

## History
Tatara and [[Stennimar\|Stennimar]] often went sailing with [[Llarimar\|Llarimar]], as it was her father's hobby. During one trip, they borrowed a boat named *[[Red Panther\|Red Panther]]* and set sail only to encounter a terrible storm. In the chaos, Tatara left the safety of the cabin to lend help to her father. A massive wave swept Tatara overboard, but Stennimar leapt into the ocean and managed to tie her to a rope despite barely knowing how to swim. Tatara was saved, but at the cost of Stennimar's life. Stennimar eventually [[Returned\|Returned]] as Lightsong the Bold.
