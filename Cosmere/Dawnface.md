|**Dawnface**|
|-|-|
|**World**||

**Dawnface** is one of the six Faces of the cube, a magical world that is shaped like a cube rather than a sphere. It shares Borders with Drakeface and [[Sixthface\|Sixthface]].
The cube is saturated with magic, and as a result the people of the cube are born with innate magic, the manifestation of which depends on the Face where they were born. The people of Dawnface can bend magic to their will, creating powerful effects through sorcery, unlike the small effects of [[Sixthface\|Sixthfacer]] [[Knack\|knacks]].
