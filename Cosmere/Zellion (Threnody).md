>“*We fled the Evil. Then we fled Threnody.*”
\-The Chorus describing their past.[1]


**Zellion** was a preacher on [[Threnody\|Threnody]] who persuaded a group of Threnodites to leave the system with him due to the infighting between Threnodites following the [[Evil\|Evil's]] arrival. Under his guidance they ended up on [[Canticle\|Canticle]].
The method he used to achieve this is unknown however the [[Chorus\|Chorus]] described spaceships as being the primary means of transportation.
His name was apparently of [[Yolen\|Yolish]] origin, however it is unknown if he himself was from Yolen or was a native Threnodite.
