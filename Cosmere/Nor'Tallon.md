**Nor'Tallon** is a city on the [[Dayside\|Dayside]] of [[Taldain\|Taldain]]. It is the capital of [[Tallon\|Tallon]]. It is located in a mountain range east of [[KraeDa\|KraeDa]], at the northern headwaters of the [[Nor'Tallon River\|Nor'Tallon River]].

## Trivia
In the original *White Sand* maps, Nor'Tallon was a nation on the eastern coast of Dayside with [[Seevis\|Seevis]] to the north and [[Tallon\|Tallon]] to the south, with its western borders extending over the mountain range along the Nor'Tallon River. However, an updated map in the *White Sand* omnibus edition merged Nor'Tallon into Tallon, with the former expressly defined as a city in the glossary.
