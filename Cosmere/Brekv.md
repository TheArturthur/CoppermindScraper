**Brekv** is a [[Thaylen\|Thaylen]] sailor on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. He works on the crew of a scouting vessel captained by [[Smta\|Smta]].
When [[Yalb\|Yalb]] spotted the *First Dreams* in the distance, he climbed up to join Brekv, who was manning the eel's nest, to ask him what he could see with his spyglass. Brekv told Yalb that the ship was not flying a banner and asked if he wanted to report it to the captain.
