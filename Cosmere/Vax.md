\-Mistborn: Secret History[1]


**Vax** is likely a planet in the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]].
Nothing is known of Vax, its peoples, or any Shards that may or may not be located there. All that is certain is that it has a manifestation of [[Investiture\|Investiture]] in which people are Initiated differently than on [[Sel\|Sel]], [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]], [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]], or [[Taldain\|Taldain]].
On Scadrial, when [[Ruin\|Ruin]] is killed by [[Vin\|Vin]] while she is holding [[Preservation\|Preservation]], [[Ati\|Ati's]] soul is finally freed from [[Ruin\|Ruin]] and appears in the Cognitive Realm. Right before moving on to the Beyond, Ati looks around Scadrial's subastral and seems to wonder aloud if it is Vax. [[Leras\|Leras]] would recognize Vax. [[Khrissalla\| Khriss]] is aware of Vax and how people are Initiated on or within it.
It is not clear whether Vax is a planet, or simply a place.

## Trivia
Brandon refuses to say anything about Vax.
If Vax is inhabited, they have not yet developed vaccines.
