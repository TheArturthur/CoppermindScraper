## Appearance and Personality
### Appearance
Rastik is a drull with brownish grey skin, large prominent ears and angled slits for a nose. Like a lot of drull, the slits for nose make them appear to have a rather flat face, with clear lines extending from their mouth to their ears. Rastik wears simple, one piece clothing, with basic patterns on the shoulders. They wear a simple belt holding a pouch, and a band of material to keep their black hair out of their face in two angle cone shapes.

### Personality
Rastik has a very joking personality, while still being perfectly obedient and respectful. Rastik offers small, sarcastic comments when Paul is struggling to come to terms with the fact he is the . Rastik has a strong belief in the [[Narrative\|Narrative]] despite all the horrors the drull have faced throughout its many iterations. They serve the Dark One in whichever way the Dark One chooses, even offering up their life for the Dark One's use, as the Narrative directs.

## History
Rastik, like all drull, was grown from the soils of [[Mirandus\|Mirandus]] an unknown time before Paul's rise as the Dark One. They were raised by their [[Kretchsires\|kretchsires]], [[Rasgor\|Rasgor]] and [[Flatik\|Flatik]].
When Paul and [[Feotora\|Feotora]] attacked the camp of drull near the [[Warfields of Karkun\|Warfields of Karkun]] Rastik was residing with, they ordered the defence of Paul after he revealed himself as the Dark One and Feotora tried to kill him. Rastik proclaimed Paul as the latest Dark One as Feotora fled to alert the [[Kingdoms of Light\|Kingdoms of Light]]. Rastik in the meanwhile, led Paul to [[Pitch\|Pitch]] and the [[Well of Sorrows\|Well of Sorrows]], providing information about the Dark One and their role in the Narrative, and offering advice along the journey.
After leading Paul to his armor once the [[Kingdoms of Light\|Kingdoms of Light]] started their attack on the city, Rastik offered their life to help fuel the weapons of the dark. After some convincing, Paul killed Rastik and bound their soul to raise the [[Ironkeeper\|Ironkeepers]] standing guard around the [[Dark Keep\|Dark Keep]]. Rastik watched on as a bound soul as Paul fought [[Kraisis\|Kraisis]] and Feotora, and was suprised alongside [[Nikka\|Nikka]] when Paul turned out victorious, the first time this had ever occurred. He was unable to offer advice on what was then to come.
