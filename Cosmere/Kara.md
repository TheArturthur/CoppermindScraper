## Appearance and Personality
No information is given about Kara's appearance, though her experience as a scout suggests an athletic build. She serves in the Alethi military, but her racial background is unspecified.
She seems to hold little regard for Vorin restrictions on gendered activities, and she has the courage to break barriers: she secretly learns the spear at an early age, she is among the first five women to join the Windrunners, and she fights alongside Bridge Four, including at the Battle of Thaylen Field and the evacuation of Hearthstone.
Kara seems to fit in well with the other members of Bridge Four, displaying an affectionately teasing sense of humor in her friendship with [[Lunamor\|Lunamor]].

## Attributes and Abilities
Kara is skilled with a spear and knows how to fight and fly in formation. From her time as a scout, she is likely also trained in the knife.
As a Windrunner squire, she relies on proximity to a full Knight to have access to her powers: the surges of [[/wiki/Surgebinding#Gravitation]] and [[/wiki/Surgebinding#Adhesion]] and the ability to heal herself. However, even as a squire, her skill with the spear and her deftness in flight allow her to hold her own in battles with the [[Heavenly Ones\|Heavenly Ones]]. [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] remarks that she is ready to advance to the [[Immortal Words\|Third Ideal]], but no [[Honorspren\|honorspren]] partners are available.
She can write in the [[Women's script\|women's script]], and she takes her own notes during scouting missions.

## History
As a child, Kara was secretly trained in the spear, and she continued to practice into adulthood. As an adult, she spent an unknown length of time as a scout and a messenger, where she served in Dalinar's army on a scouting squad with [[Lyn\|Lyn]], [[Laran\|Laran]], [[Mela\|Mela]], and an unnamed fifth member. Together, they became the first five women to try out for and subsequently join Bridge Four in their initial recruitment effort. She and the others of her cohort learned to use Stormlight at some point within the span of five days. She gained additional spear training from Peet and other members of Bridge Four, and she learned to fight and fly in formation. She fought alongside the men of Bridge Four at the Battle of Thaylen Field.
During the year between Thaylen Field and the evacuation of Hearthstone, one can infer she continued to fight alongside her fellow Windrunners, but she also participated in scouting missions to [[Singer\|singer]]-occupied Alethkar, taking notes on the general condition of cities and their inhabitants as well as singer troop placements. Notably, she reported on the city of [[Tomat\|Tomat]] where [[Hesina\|Hesina's]] father lived. It's unknown if she was the female Windrunner scout who discovered the encampment of surviving [[Listeners\|listeners]] on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]].
At the evacuation of Hearthstone, she was one of the few squires permitted to engage the [[Heavenly Ones\|Heavenly Ones]] in aerial combat, where she scored a hit on one with her spear. Afterward, she engaged in comfortable, teasing banter with Lunamor after Bridge Four returned to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]]. She later joined the majority of Bridge Four on the campaign to Emul.

## Trivia
Many Bridge Four members are cameos of Brandon's friends, and she may be a cameo of [[Kara Stewart\|Kara Stewart]].
