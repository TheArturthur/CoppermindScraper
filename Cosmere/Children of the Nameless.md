Seeking revenge on the man she believes responsible for the failure and the consequent destruction of everything she loves, she breaks into the manor of the local lord, a known consorter with demons. There she discovers the beginnings of an even greater mystery… starting with the fact the Lord of the Manor is anything but local…*”

## Summary
Tacenda Verlasen is a young woman who lives in a small village in the Approaches, a remote area of Innistrad. She and her twin sister Willia were born with the extraordinary power to protect their village from the encroaching darkness and monsters, Tacenda with her Warding Song and Willia with her skills as a warrior. With this power, however, comes an accompanying curse--Tacenda becomes blind during the daytime and Willia becomes blind during the night, meaning neither can see at the same time.
One day, strange geists attack the villagers, led by a corporeal figure in a mask and cloak who appears to be the Man of the Manor, Davriel Cane. Ignoring Tacenda's Warding Song, they flow through the village, taking each and every one of Tacenda's family, friends and neighbors. Having lost all she has known and loved, she sets out to confront the Man of the Manor. After Tacenda attempts and fails to kill Davriel, he convinces her that he had nothing to do with the geists in town. Though he is initially unconcerned, Tacenda shows him that it's in his best interest to help her get to the bottom of the mystery. Davriel brings his retinue of demons to investigate and finds that the bodies of the villagers are in a state of suspended animation while their souls are gone.
Further clues lead them to the priory, where Davriel confronts the prioress. In the basement of the priory, they find that Tacenda's twin sister Willia is in fact still alive and has been commanding the geists this entire time. Willia is under the influence of a portion of a strange Entity, which has been driving her to collect the souls of the villagers to reclaim its power. When all seems lost, with Willia's geists closing in on Davriel and Tacenda, Tacenda remembers a song which allows her to defeat the geists and her sister and finally reunite the pieces of power belonging to the Entity. Upon taking up this vast power, Tacenda vanishes.

## Main Characters

## Setting
The novella is set in the Magic: The Gathering multiverse. In this multiverse, reality is separated into innumerable planes, each of which is a world or universe separated from all others by a void called the Blind Eternities. Though the planes are generally separate, there are certain individuals who are born with a "spark" and can become Planeswalkers, capable of shifting themselves instantaneously from plane to plane. Each plane is generally a unique setting influenced by real-world historical or literary settings. The plane of Innistrad, where *Children of the Nameless* is set, is primarily influenced by 18th and 19th century gothic horror. Creatures of the night such as werewolves, vampires, mad scientists, and zombies threaten the human population of the plane, who are protected by angels, holy symbols, and fearless warriors of the light.
The entirety of the story takes place in the Approaches, a remote area of the central Innistrad province of Kessig.
