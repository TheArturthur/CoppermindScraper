**Barb** is [[Wilson\|Wilson]]'s grandniece and [[Stephen Leeds\|Stephen Leeds]]' new butler.
Barb is a young woman with short blonde hair. Stephen thinks she looks awkward wearing coachman's gear. Barb is a upbeat person who truly wishes to be of help to Stephen, but Stephen repeatedly rejects her help.
Barb is a competent butler and chauffeur, but is new to Stephen and his aspects, so isn't the best at working around them as Wilson does. She is able to make lemonade using Wilson's recipe.
She shadowed Wilson buttling for some time before he left Stephen on his seventieth birthday. As Stephen's new butler, she drove him to the fairground and operated  for him. She drove him to WODE and attempted to help him infiltrate, but Stephen rebuffed her offers of help. She returned after Stephen finished his infiltration to pick him up and drive him to Wilson's birthday party.
