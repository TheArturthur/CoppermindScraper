## Geography
Desh is a small nation that is situated at the foot of a mountainous area in western Roshar. It borders [[Azir\|Azir]] to the east and [[Yezier\|Yezier]] to the south. [[Shinovar\|Shinovar]] lies to the west and [[Babatharnam\|Babatharnam]] to the north, but they are separated by the mountains. During the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]] era, Desh was a part of [[Makabakam\|Makabakam]].

## Politics and Culture
As a member of the Azish empire, Desh formally recognizes the [[Prime Aqasix\|Prime Aqasix]] as its emperor. In practice, the member states of the empire are generally self-governing, although they follow Azir's lead in international matters and maintain deference to the emperor through certain cultural customs.
People from Desh were common visitors to the [[Tashikk\|Tashikki]] city of [[Yeddaw\|Yeddaw]]. [[Lift\|Lift]] characterizes their clothing as "rural" in appearance with lighter colors, similar to clothing worn in [[Alm\|Alm]]. Many of Desh's inhabitants are nomads, who travel between various waystops. Such waystops are typically marked by stone obelisks.

## History
During the Silver Kingdoms Period, the land that would come to be known as Desh was part of the kingdom of [[Makabakam\|Makabakam]]. Though Makabakam eventually lost authority and collapsed, causing various cultural groups and nations to form in its ruins. At some point during or after this event, Desh was formed.
At some point prior to 1174, Desh came to be a member state of the Azish Empire.
Lift visited Desh in her past and enjoyed it, as few people had tried to kill her during her time there.
One of Desh's ambassadors was in [[Azimir\|Azimir]] when [[Noura\|Noura]] told [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] that the [[Makabak\|Makabak]] empire would join his coalition against [[Odium\|Odium]].
