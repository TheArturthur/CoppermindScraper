\-Lunamor[1]


**Kali'kalin** is an [[Unkalaki\|Unkalaki]] person or deity on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. The Horneaters believe that he has a ghost. The Unkalaki sometimes curse with the name of this ghost, simply referring to it as Kali'kalin's ghost. This is likely associated with a similar Horneater expression, Kali'kalin'da.
