**Hikiri** is a [[Dreamwatch\|Dreamwatch]] companion from [[Nagadan\|Nagadan]] under [[Tesuaka Tatomi\|Tesuaka Tatomi's]] command.

## Appearance and Personality
Hikiri is tall, with an impressive beard and a bald head. He wears a formal painter's uniform, with a coat short in front and long in the back. Hikiri is patient, yet assertive.

## History
Hikiri's team was summoned to [[Kilahito\|Kilahito]] from [[Jito\|Jito]] after [[Tojin\|Tojin]] reported a stable [[Nightmare\|nightmare]] previously encountered by [[Nikaro\|Nikaro]]. After their arrival, Nikaro attempted to warn them of an incoming army of stable nightmares. Hikiri answered the door with a yawn and took Nikaro inside to see Tesuaka, who asked Hikiri to record the painter's statement. Before forcing him to leave, paying no mind to his claims about the army of stable nightmares, Hirki explained to Nikaro that only painters with connections, no matter their skill, are appointed a position in the Dreamwatch, and he encouraged Nikaro to be content with his job as a regular nightmare painter. Hikiri was forced to seek alternative employment after the Dreamwatch disbanded.
