|**Knack**|
|-|-|
|**World of Origin**|Cube|

A **knack** is a simple magical ability that is gained by a resident of [[Sixthface\|Sixthface]] simply by virtue of living in the land saturated by magic. Most people have several of them. Those abilities are distinct from the magic possessed by [[Dawnface\|Dawnfacers]], which is said to be much more powerful.
The only knacks demonstrated are those of [[Skip\|Skip]], and include the ability of smelling irresistible to dragons and hearing punctuation and spelling.
