## Appearance and Personality
Sor is described as being the opposite of his employee [[Gremmy\|Gremmy]]. Whereas Gremmy is squat and flat-faced, Sor sits tall and straight. He is, for all intents and purposes, Gremmy's boss, however; he rarely mentions this, on the off chance that he might have to pay for Gremmy's tab.
Though he could afford the wine at [[Brick's Tavern\|Brick's Tavern]], he sips beer, so he will not appear wealthy enough to be able purchase said wine.

## History
### Diggen's Point and Tress' Escape
Sor lived on Diggen's Point with his daughter [[Gret\|Gret]] for an unknown period of time. Though, like most residents of Diggen's Point, he lived on The Rock for most of her life. Unable to leave, per the [[Verdant King\|Verdant King]] and [[Charlie's father\|The Duke's]] instructions.
[[Lem\|Lem]] knew that Tress would need the help of all three men. And so, Lem cashed in on silent favors tailed up by invisible ledgers. As a result of this, Sor; along with [[Gremmy\|Gremmy]] and [[Brick\|Brick]] arrived at [[Tress\|Tress']] house, and demanded to assist her in her escape of [[Diggen's Point\|Diggen's Point]]. Sor was able to assist in accomplishing this by using his position as dockmaster, instructing Gremmy to roll a sixth keg alongside five other barrels of ale, which contained Gret, Sor's daughter, and feathers, to muffle her breathing. The "inspector" was able to hear Gret inside the barrel and kicked it over, revealing her inside. This caused Gremmy to break down and start crying. However, Gremmy, Sor, Brick and Gret all knew this was a ruse, as the [[Inspector\|Inspector]], was in fact Tress in disguise.

### Tress' Return
Tress returned to Diggen's Point, as captain of the *[[Two Cups\|Two Cups]]* but only for a short time, long enough to deliver the King's new instructions, along with several other letters, and retrieve her family. During her return, she took special care to thank Gremmy, Brick, Gret, and Sor for their assistance in helping her initially escape **The Rock.**
