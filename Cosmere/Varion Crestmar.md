## Appearance and Personality
Varion is a tall, confident man in his 50's with silver hair, and is viewed as arrogant by his opponents.

[[Kern\|Admiral Kern]] calls him a Warrior, and indeed he is a tactical genius and has spent his entire adult life honing his battle skills as the perfect commander.

## History
### Reunification War
Varion was a nearly perfect military leader. He spent decades conquering the galaxy in the name of the [[High Emperor\|High Emperor]]. However, when that was completed, he turned on the Emperor, and began fighting the High Empire instead. With the powerful army and superior technologies he gained during his galactic conquest, the High Empire doesn't stand much chance. Foreseeing this, the empire cloned him and his clone is named [[Dennison Crestmar\|Dennison]], publicly known as his brother.
He committed suicide after Dennison simulated him losing, having never learned what failure felt like.
