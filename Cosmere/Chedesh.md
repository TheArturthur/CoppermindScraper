**Chedesh** was a nation on ancient [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]], which had a large empire.

## Legacy
The people of Chedesh are described as having dominated the world in their age. However, their writings are sparse, and they have long faded away in the present day, though [[Hoid\|Hoid]] says their memory remains.
The Chedesh people are credited with discovering the tropical, jungle region that would later be [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]], along with the [[Tears of Edgli\|Tears of Edgli]], though the [[Pahn Kahl\|Pahn Kahl]] are originally native to the region. [[Vo\|Vo]] was on a Chedesh ship, and [[Returned\|Returned]] along the coast of Hallandren. The people of that ship found a kingdom, which they name Hanald, on the beach that [[T'Telir\|T'Telir]] is located. Hanald is eventually renamed to Hallandren, its modern name.
The people of Chedesh travel the [[Bright Sea\|Bright Sea]] from the east, opposite from [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]], which is a similar description as to where [[Tedradel\|Tedradel]] is from, so Tedradel could be where Chedesh was originally.
