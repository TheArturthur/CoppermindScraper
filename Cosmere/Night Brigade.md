## Methodology and Goals
The Night Brigade consider themselves to be an army and they wear full military uniforms; their commander holds the title of the [[Admiral\|Admiral]]. They are well-known throughout the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]] as being brutally efficient, but also precise in their destruction, giving them a terrifying reputation. While they've wrecked entire planets, they do not go out of their way to pillage and burn thoughtlessly. They -- or at least some of their members -- have some affection for Threnodite offshoot cultures, calling them "cousins".
While they presumably usually work as mercenaries for hire, at times the Night Brigade work towards their own goals -- for example, they chase after [[Nomad\|Nomad]] and the [[Dawnshard\|Dawnshard]] he once held. By the time of Nomad`s arival on [[Canticle\|Canticle]], they have been hunting him ceaselessly for decades. Like all others who seek to possess a Dawnshard, the Night Brigade have been hiding their goal behind the fact that there is an incredible bounty on Nomad's head. It is unclear if they were the ones to have posted the bounty.

## Capabilities
>“*They’re the only army I know that makes you keep on fighting after you’ve died.*”
\-Nomad[1]


The Night Brigade's trademark power is the ability to control the [[Shade\|shades]] created from dead [[Threnody\|Threnodites]]. As such, the members of the Brigade are expected to keep on serving after their deaths. Their shades are tamed by the Night Brigade through methods unknown, though likely tied to the Continuity Chain, a weapon wielded by the Admiral. The Admiral herself is capable of commanding the shades with her mind, without the need for vocalized commands.
Aside from their control over shades, the Night Brigade also possesses at least one spaceship, which allows them to bring devastation to entire planets. This is also how they chase after Nomad. Their methods for locating him, however, are unknown; while they are able to scan a planet for his presence, how they find the correct planet is left unexplained. They can track him down within merely a few days of his skip, ensuring that he is constantly on the run.
The Night Brigade possesses the knowledge necessary to use [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgy]]. They are aware of the cosmere's secrets, including the [[Dawnshard\|Dawnshards]] and what they're capable of.

## History
 by  Nabetse Zitro  The Night Brigade arriving on [[Canticle\|Canticle]]
Very little is known about the formation of the Night Brigade. There was once a group on [[Threnody\|Threnody]] that sought to free their homeland from the [[Evil\|Evil]]; it is possible that it might have ties to the mercenary company. What is known is that the Brigade was formed of Threnodites, and has somehow gained the ability to command the [[Shade\|shades]]. At some point they also acquired a spaceship, as well as a reputation for brutality.
The Night Brigade began hunting [[Nomad\|Nomad]] some time after he passed on his [[Dawnshard\|Dawnshard]]. He initially turned himself in, hoping that he would be let go once they realized he no longer held their prize. However, he soon discovered that they would be able to turn him into a [[Hemalurgy\|spike]] which they could then use for tracking down the Dawnshard's current holder. Nomad managed to escape them then, and has been on the run since, as the Night Brigade pursues him ceaselessly over the course of decades.
After Nomad arrived on [[Canticle\|Canticle]], the Night Brigade appeared only hours later, flying into the planet's orbit and beginning their search. A group of Night Brigade's members, including staff seargant [[Truth-Is-Waiting\|Truth-Is-Waiting]] and the [[Admiral\|Admiral]] herself, descended upon the surface. They stole one of the local house ships in order to blend in with the people of Canticle and question them regarding Nomad's whereabouts. Before they were able to locate him, Nomad managed to skip to another planet, eluding them again. However, during the same search, Truth-Is-Waiting discovered that the planet held a [[Scadrial\|Scadrian]] research outpost, which could be questioned for information.

## Trivia
In early drafts, the group was called the "Dusk Brigade"; however, due to an error of transcription, this was mistaken to be the "Dust Brigade" for many years. Brandon eventually renamed it to the "Night Brigade" due to the fact that he already had a character named [[Sixth of the Dusk\|Dusk]] in the cosmere.
The organization as a whole is a reference to .
Despite the name, the Night Brigade has no meaningful connection to [[Midnight Essence\|Night Aether]].
