**Ehen** is a well-known [[Aonic\|Aonic]] poet on [[Sel\|Sel]]. Their name is derived from [[/wiki/Aon#Ehe]], which literally means "fire", but is also associated with danger. Poets and artists such as Ehen sometimes take a new name based on Ehe upon reaching maturity as an artist, to signify the inherent danger of artistry and to distance themselves from their older works.
