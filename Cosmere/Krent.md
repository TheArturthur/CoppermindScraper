**Krent** is [[House Ladrian\|House Ladrian's]] coachman in [[Elendel\|Elendel]].
He was present after [[Tillaume\|Tillaume]] caused an explosion in an attempt to kill High Lord [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]], [[Wayne\|Wayne]] and Lady [[Marasi Colms\|Marasi Colms]]. He stood outside Ladrian Mansion in a state of shock, hands on his head, eyes wide, watching the mansion burn.
