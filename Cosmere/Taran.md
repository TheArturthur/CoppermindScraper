**Taran** is a serving boy in [[Tvlakv\|Tvlakv's]] slave caravan on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
He is described as lanky, and he tends to the [[Chull\|chulls]] that pull the caravan. He is present when Tvlakv transports [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] and a number of other slaves to the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]]. Along with [[Bluth\|Bluth]] and [[Tag\|Tag]], he appears to be in Tvlakv's employ, as he is not kept in a cage like the slaves.
Taran's fate is unknown after the slave caravan reached the Sadeas warcamp. When [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] travels with Tvlakv's caravan after the attack on the *[[Wind's Pleasure\|Wind's Pleasure]]*, Taran is not mentioned and Bluth has been tasked with caring for the chulls.
