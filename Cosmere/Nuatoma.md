>“*Many of our nuatoma--this thing, it is the same as your lighteyes, only their eyes are not light--*”
\-Lunamor to Kaladin and Teft[1]


A *nuatoma* is a leader of an [[Unkalaki\|Unkalaki]] clan on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. They are a type of noble, the Horneater equivalent of an [[Alethi\|Alethi]] [[Brightlord\|Brightlord]].

## Social Status
It is not clear how an individual becomes *nuatoma*, although both birth order and heritage are major factors in Unkalaki social standing. Since all Unkalaki are [[Darkeyes\|darkeyed]], eye color is not a consideration. The relatives of a *nuatoma* act as their guards and servants, often performing multiple jobs. It is implied that a *nuatoma* leads each of the [[Horneater Peaks\|Horneater Peaks]]. There are occasional skirmishes between peaks, presumably led by the *nuatoma*.
When [[Lunamor\|Lunamor]] sees [[Phendorana\|Phendorana]], who has obvious importance among [[Honorspren\|honorspren]], he asks [[Syl\|Syl]] if Phendorana is like an honorspren *nuatoma*; because Syl can remember Phendorana berating her for wanting to seek [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]], she agrees.

## Quest for Shards
>“*The nuatoma, they see our lack of Shards as a great shame. They want these weapons very badly.*”
\-Lunamor[1]

The lack of Shards among the Unkalaki is a source of embarrassment for the *nuatoma*, and many have traveled to [[Vedenar\|Vedenar]] or [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] offering significant financial incentives in exchange for the chance to duel a [[Shardbearer\|Shardbearer]] and win a Shard. They believe that the first *nuatoma* to win a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] would gain sufficient power to become the first *tana'kai*—similar to a king—in many years. Either the respect for a Shardbearer or the fear of an easy defeat would keep the other peaks from skirmishing with a *nuatoma* who holds a Shard.
All of the *nuatoma* who have challenged Alethi Shardbearers have been killed. [[Kef'ha\|Kef'ha]], Lunamor's *nuatoma*, chooses to duel [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas]], believing that it will be easier to win against someone who only possesses [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]] first, and then to challenge someone else for their Blade afterwards. He believes that his relatives will simply become servants of House Sadeas if he dies. However, sometime in early 1173, Sadeas kills Kef'ha without a proper duel and then kills some of his family members who protest before seizing their property anyway. Sadeas does not know what to do with the surviving Horneaters, but he makes soldiers or servants out of most of them. Lunamor briefly serves as his cook, but he puts [[Chull\|chull]] dung in Sadeas' food, earning him an assignment to the [[Bridge crew\|bridge crews]].
After [[Cord\|Cord]] receives her Shardplate, Lunamor finds it remarkable that their nation's first Shardbearer is not a *nuatoma*, but a young woman.
