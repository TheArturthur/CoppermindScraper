**New Clipperton** is an independent city-state that is officially recognized by the Restored American Union. New Clipperton is the location of the only known Snapshot Project. Mexico City, another city-state, and New Clipperton have a treaty with each other for immigration and transferable citizenship.  All the city-states use American coins and Canadian one and two-dollar coins but mostly use credit, an electronic currency because all coins stopped being minted two years ago.

## History
Clipperton was occupied by the Restored American Union until they pulled out and the city was renamed New Clipperton. When the Americans moved out they pressured the city-state to purchase the Snapshot Project.
