>“*The end pages, however, described the culmination of the notes and sketches. A kind of arcane device in the shape of a sphere. You could break it and absorb the power within, which would briefly Connect you to Preservation—like the lines he'd seen in the space between moments.*”
\-Kelsier finding an Ire member's research notes[1]


The **Ire's orb** is an arcane device that can magically grant [[Connection\|Connection]]. The members of the Ire intended to use it to allow one of their members to Ascend as a Vessel of a [[Shard\|Shard]] of [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]]. Instead, [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] stole it and used it on himself, allowing him to temporarily take up the power of [[Preservation\|Preservation]].

## Appearance
>“*[Kelsier] strolled over and picked up the large glass orb. It showed no discernible way of being opened, other than shattering it. He held the glowing orb before him and shook it, gazing at the incredible, mesmerizing liquid light within.*”
\-Kelsier's theft of the orb[4]


The orb is made of glass and is filled with purified [[Dor\|Dor]], a form of [[Investiture\|Investiture]] from [[Sel\|Sel]]. In its purified state, the Dor takes the form of a bright, glowing liquid that can be seen moving and swirling within the orb. Kelsier describes the contents as "mesmerizing liquid light" and notes that Ire drink something that is similar in appearance, although the orb is much brighter. It is large and somewhat heavy.

## Magic
The Ire use an unknown method to distill the Dor, stripping out other [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual]] aspects such as [[Identity\|Identity]]. This means that the powers of the orb are not keyed to a specific individual. Shards can sense the power of the orb unless it is hidden with special wards. [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgy]] may interfere with the orb's effects.
The Ire are ancient and highly cosmere-aware, but they may not have been fully prepared for the effects of the orb. No similar devices are known to have been used before the Connection orb was created.

## History
### Origin
The Ire, a group of ancient [[Elantrian\|Elantrians]], constructed a fortress in the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]]. Within the fortress, they performed research regarding the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]] and [[Realmatic Theory\|Realmatic Theory]] and created several unusual arcane devices. At least one member kept a detailed research journal full of notes and sketches, including a description of an orb that would contain the power to Connect someone to the Shard [[Preservation\|Preservation]] and allow them to take up its power. [[Alonoe\|Alonoe]] and [[Elrao\|Elrao]] implied that the Ire had been working on their strategy to take over Preservation's power for quite some time, although they did consider other uses for the orb before settling on their plan. The orb was critical to their scheme and they were actively monitoring the failing health of Preservation's Vessel, [[Leras\|Leras]], because his death would create their window to act. The Ire were concerned about [[Ruin\|Ruin]] sensing the orb, but one of their members placed wards on the orb that she believed to be completely effective.

### With the Ire
Kelsier, as a [[Cognitive Shadow\|Cognitive Shadow]], befriended [[Leras\|Leras]], the Vessel of Preservation. He soon discovered the Ire's fortress and overheard their plans to take the power of a Shard. He snooped around the fortress and found a notebook with details on the orb. He knew from previous conversations with Leras that Connection must exist to Ascend as a Shard, and realized that the Ire planned to use the orb to artificially create the necessary Connection. Partly due to his friendship with Leras, he vowed to steal it.
Kelsier realized that the orb was too difficult to steal directly from the well-guarded fortress, so he waited about a week until an expedition of the Ire and some guards left on their mission to take control of Preservation. Four of the Ire members carried decoy glass orbs, while Alonoe carried the real one. Kelsier stole one decoy orb and confirmed that the authentic one was in Alonoe's pack. He pretended to be Ruin and caused chaos and confusion in the group, eventually isolating Alonoe and forcing her to give up the orb.

### Used by Kelsier
Kelsier traveled as quickly as he could to find Preservation, hoping that the orb would be able to save Leras. He eventually found a way to talk to Leras and revealed the orb; Leras seemed to recognize its power, but told Kelsier that it could not help him. As Kelsier tried to communicate with [[Vin\|Vin]] in [[Fadrex City\|Fadrex City]], Ruin appeared; he could not sense the orb and wondered why he did not sense Kelsier sooner. Kelsier realized that the Ire's wards on the orb were effective and were able to hide him temporarily. Kelsier continued to try and reach out to Vin but Ruin interfered. Kelsier asked Leras about the orb again, and Leras told him that he was "already dead" and couldn't be healed, and also implied that the orb would not work correctly with Vin while she still had a [[Hemalurgic\|Hemalurgic]] spike.
As Leras died, Kelsier decided to use the orb himself despite Leras's warnings that the power belonged to Vin. He smashed it open using a knife that he was previously given by [[Nazh\|Nazh]], and the liquid sprayed over his body. He immediately saw glowing threads connecting him to everything that he could perceive. Using the threads and the magic of the orb, he was able to somehow instinctively draw in Preservation's power, Ascending to become a Shard. Although he quickly realized that he could not overpower Ruin, Kelsier did use the orb in the way that the Ire intended. He seemingly prevented Ruin from [[Splinter\|Splintering]] Preservation, allowing the power to be transferred to Vin.

## Riino's Orb
This page or section deals with theories or speculation.Please read carefully and note that this is not necessarily canonical.

>“*[Riino] whipped the cloth off the table, revealing a large crystalline globe. It glowed with a powerful light, bathing the room in luminescence. Kaladin blinked against it. Was that Stormlight?*”
\-Kaladin sees Riino's orb[16]

Several centuries after the Catacendre, [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] encountered a member of the Ire named [[Riino\|Riino]] inhabiting a lighthouse in [[Roshar\|Roshar's]] Cognitive Realm. Riino, who was posing as a fortune teller called the "Rii Oracle", possessed a globe that at least superficially resembled the Connection orb. It was large, crystalline, and glowed brightly with a shifting, transfixing light. He mentioned that the orb functioned best during [[Highstorm\|highstorms]] and also let it slip that only Invested individuals were able to use the orb.
When Kaladin touched the orb, he was pulled into an unusual vision where colors seemed to stream all around him. He saw [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] in grave danger surrounded by nine shadows, and then a brief flash of what appeared to be [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]]. Riino was shocked that Kaladin had seen anything and realized that he was a [[Surgebinder\|Surgebinder]]. Kaladin had a headache and felt drained after the experience; he relayed the vision to [[Azure\|Azure]], who was skeptical but admitted that it was possible to see into the [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual Realm]], where time loses relevance and glimpses of future possibilities may be visible. Kaladin was emphatic that his visions felt real, and some aspects of them were later borne out; Dalinar had to forcibly resist becoming [[Odium\|Odium's]] champion and [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|a massive battle]] occurred at Thaylen City.
Given the Ire's experience in distilling the Dor to create pure Connection, this could imply that the orb contained [[Fortune\|Fortune]], another Spiritual property that is related to "luck" and future sight. However, unlike the Connection orb, Riino's orb could be used without directly touching its contents. Kaladin also noted that the orb's light looked extremely similar to [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]] (which also has a connection to the Spiritual Realm) and that Riino seemed eager to trade for infused [[Polestone\|gemstones]].
