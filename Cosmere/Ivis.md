## Appearance and Personality
Like most [[Ardent\|ardents]], she has a shaved head and flowing robes. She wears a glove on her [[Safehand\|safehand]].

## Attributes and Abilities
Ivis appears to be one of [[Alethkar\|Alethkar's]] most skilled [[Ardent\|ardents]] with a sword. [[Zahel\|Zahel]] and [[Kelerand\|Kelerand]], two expert swordsmen, fully trust her to perform training without their direct supervision. [[Highprince\|Highprince]] [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] also knows her by name and trusts her with important tasks. She can handle a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] and is highly familiar with all ten stances, which is unusual for a woman in Alethkar.

## History
### Shattered Plains
Ivis is one of many [[Ardent\|ardents]] that reported to [[Zahel\|Zahel]] on the [[Lighteyed\|lighteyed]] training grounds in [[Highprince\|Highprince]] [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin's]] warcamp on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]]. Zahel assigned her to spar with [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]] using one of King [[Elhokar\|Elhokar's]] [[Shardblade\|Shardblades]], hoping to familiarize them with the [[Stances\|stances]] used by Shardbearers, should they ever have to fight one. Although Ivis's robes concealed her figure, [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] considered the sight of a woman holding a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] to be odd, although it was no odder than seeing a [[Darkeyes\|darkeyes]] hold one.
Ivis had Bridge Four use pieces of wood as practice swords and walked them through the stances. After about an hour, they took a break; Ivis told [[Yake\|Yake]] and [[Teft\|Teft]] to stop dawdling and come back to practice, but she did not call Kaladin, who seemed to intimidate the ardents. After Kaladin rejoined the group and continued practicing, Ivis corrected his grip, and laughed when she realized he had expected to learn swordsmanship very swiftly.

### Urithiru
Ivis relocated to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] after the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]]. She continued to train soldiers, now reporting to [[Kelerand\|Kelerand]] instead of Zahel. Dalinar told Kelerand to have Ivis expand the training grounds in Urithiru to keep the soldiers occupied.
