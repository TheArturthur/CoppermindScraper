>“*With all due respect, Lord Ladrian, you are a new parent, and obviously don't understand how to raise a child. You don’t give in to their demands; you hold firm, knowing that your decisions are best for them. They will eventually see reason. As a father is to a son, Elendel is to the Outer Cities.*”
\-Melstrom arguing for the Elendel Supremacy Bill[1]


**Dupon Melstrom** is a politician in [[Elendel\|Elendel]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. In 348 [[Catacendre\|PC]], he is the sitting senator for the dockworkers in the [[Elendel Senate\|Elendel Senate]].

## Appearance and Personality
[[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]] considers Melstrom to be a puppet for two houses that generally oppose Wax's politics, [[House Hasting\|House Hasting]] and [[House Erikell\|House Erikell]]. Melstrom and Wax are therefore antagonistic towards one another. During the debate over the [[Elendel Supremacy Bill\|Elendel Supremacy Bill]], Melstrom exhibited disdain for the [[/wiki/Elendel Basin#Outer Cities]] and their ability to govern themselves in the face of the perceived threat from the [[Southern Scadrian\|Southern Scadrians]].

## History
Melstrom was considered to be a powerful senator. His close alignment with Hasting and Erikell elicited suspicion from Wax, who investigated the senator's relationship with the two houses. During the debate over the Elendel Supremacy Bill, Melstrom addressed Wax in a patronizing manner; Wax then produced a letter with direct evidence of Melstrom's corruption, hoping to stall the vote on the bill. Melstrom looked deflated as he knew his political career was seriously damaged, but Governor [[Varlance\|Varlance]] declined to hold impropriety hearings until after the vote. Instead, he simply disqualified Melstrom, [[Vennis Hasting\|Vennis Hasting]], and the Erikell senator from voting on the bill. The bill then narrowly passed, despite Wax's efforts.
Melstrom was one of the senators implicated in documents discovered by [[Tobal Copper\|Tobal Copper]] and [[Maraga Dulcet\|Maraga Dulcet]] related to the [[Set\|Set's]] plan to bomb Elendel. However, Wax later discovered that many of those documents were forgeries, making it unlikely that Melstrom was actually aware of the Set's activities.
