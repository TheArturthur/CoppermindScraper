## History
### El Paso
Parik went to El Paso to work with [[Dean Knighthawk\|Dean Knighthawk]] and to learn his secrets. He claimed he is a California [[Reckoners\|Reckoner]]. He gave himself a long Eastern European name that is hard to pronounce, so Knighthawk just called him “The Californian.” When [[Zeff\|Zeff]] and [[Jax (Reckoners)\|Jax]] visited to get some new motivator technology from Knighthawk, Jax unwittingly revealed useful information about motivators to Parik. Unbeknownst to Zeff and Jax, Parik attached a GPS tracker to their truck, later allowing the city of Lux to follow them.

### Experiments
As Lifeforce’s chief scientist, Parik was assigned to help Lifeforce obtain the powers of other Epics. Their success was largely made possible with information that Jax revealed at El Paso. Using bits of the Epic such as a severed hand, they attached the bit of epic to Lifeforce and integrated the flesh with Lifeforce’s. Parik managed to give Lifeforce the powers of the Epic [[Shiversting\|Shiversting]], but failed when trying to give him the powers of [[Liquidyne\|Liquidyne]]. Parik also assisted Lifeforce with his work in the , and wanted Lifeforce to keep more precise records.

### Captured by the Reckoners
When the Reckoners broke into Parik’s lab, he hid in a cabinet, eavesdropping on them. He accidentally made a noise, and was discovered and captured by the Reckoners. He was interrogated, but didn’t give away any information at first. Jax then went to the ladder drop site, then dangled Parik over the edge and threatened to drop him. Parik gave Jax the desired information about [[Languish\|Languish]]’s weakness, fearing for his life. Jax tried to drop Parik over the edge, but he was saved by Paige. Not wanting to kill him directly, they put Parik onto the ladder and lowered him three-quarters of the way to the ground. They said that if he was strong, then he could climb back up, and that if he wasn’t, then he would die. It is unknown wether he survived or not.
