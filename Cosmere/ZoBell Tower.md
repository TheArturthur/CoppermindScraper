**ZoBell Tower** is a skyscraper in the Fourth Octant of [[Elendel\|Elendel]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
The tower is around twenty stories tall and has decorative stonework and balconies. Like many sky scrapers in the city, it narrows as it rises and is built with steel girders. It has a coach portico at the entrance. There is also a green in front of the tower.
The entire top floor is an open penthouse ringed with windows, at least some of which have balconies. It is lit by crystal chandeliers and has red carpeting. During [[Lady ZoBell's party\|Lady ZoBell's party]] in 342 [[Catacendre\|PC]], it is decorated with small display stands with glass boxes containing impressive specimens of [[Allomantic\|Allomantic]] metals.
