The **Deepest Ones** are unknown beings in the [[Forests of Hell\|Forests of Hell]] on [[Threnody\|Threnody]].
It is unknown if the Deepest Ones actually exist or if they are just a myth. [[Silence Montane\|Silence Montane]], who is not afraid to battle large numbers of [[Shade\|shades]], fears even a single Deepest One; she seems to believe that it is nearly impossible to escape if one attacks. They seem to be drawn by fighting, perhaps specifically fighting between [[Shade\|shades]] and humans.

## Trivia
The Deepest Ones are planned to be heavily involved in a future [[Threnody\|Threnody]] novel, tentatively titled *The Night Brigade*.
