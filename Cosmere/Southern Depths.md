The **Southern Depths** is the ocean to the south of [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. It lies off the coast of [[Tukar\|Tukar]], [[Marat\|Marat]], and [[Thaylenah\|Thaylenah]]. It is presumably quite deep. It also likely extends to the south pole of the planet. Control of Thaylenah's waters dictates control of the entirety of the Southern Depth, however, true dominance of the region requires control of Emul and Tukar as well.
In 1173, [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] and [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]] traveled through the Southern Depths on the *Wind's Pleasure* on their way to the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]].
The strategic importance of Thaylenah led to the [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringer]] forces attacking Thaylen City near the beginning of the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]]. A Thaylen merchant ship tried to scout for Voidbringers in the Southern Depths near Marat and spotted a large number of ships at dock along the coast. The ship relayed the information via [[Spanreed\|spanreed]]. Then, figures with glowing eyes--the [[Fused\|Fused]]--rose from a nearby city, attacking the ship, and the ship was never heard from again. Shortly thereafter, the Voidbringer forces launched from Marat to Thaylen City, using the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]] to propel them quickly across the Southern Depths, triggering the [[Battle of Thaylen Fields\|Battle of Thaylen Fields]].
The Urithiru coalition gained control of the Southern Depths several months after the Battle at Thaylen Field, after the Thaylen navy won the area and forced the enemy ships to retreat to the coast of Iri.
