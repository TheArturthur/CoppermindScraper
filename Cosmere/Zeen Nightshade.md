>“*To me, there is only one clan that matters: humankind. Before we crashed here, we were all part of the same fleet—and someday all the wandering clans will remember that. They will come when we call them. They'll gather together, and we’ll form a city and build a civilization again.*”

**Zeen Nightshade** callsign **Chaser** is a former [[DDF\|DDF]] pilot.

## Attributes and Abilities
He is a skilled [[Starfighter\|starfighter]] pilot and a [[Cytonics\|cytonic]].

## History
Shortly before the [[Battle of Alta\|Battle of Alta]], he was with Spensa on the surface when he noticed unusual debris falling from the sky. The "debris" turned out to be an attack by the Krell. Upon call, he joined the fight. Near the end of the fight, he started to act erratically. At first, he seemed to be able to react to Krell fighters before they acted. Then, he flew out from an opening of the debris field, to where the Krell came from. After a while, he returned and started to fire at friendly ships. Realizing he was maddened, [[Ironsides\|Ironsides]] ordered him shot down by [[Cobb\|Cobb]], his wingmate. Afterwards, he was known to the public not as a turncoat but as a deserter. This also caused Spensa to be branded "the daughter of a coward." By the time of Spensa's mission to [[Starsight (station)\|Starsight]], it is relatively well-known, at least in the [[DDF\|DDF]], that he only did so because the Krell had used his cytonic abilities to make him think that he was firing on enemies and the DDF began taking precautions to make sure that other cytonic pilots cannot be influenced in that manner again.
