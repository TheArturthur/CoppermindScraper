[[Karkun\|Karkun]], the first [[Dark One (title)\|Dark One]], created the keep in which the [[Well of Sorrows\|Well of Sorrows]] is contained. The doors of the keep stood closed for a lifetime, until [[Paul Tanasin\|Paul Tanasin]] rose as the [[Dark One (title)\|Dark One]] to open them.

## Layout and Design
The Dark Keep is located centrally in the city of Pitch, rising above the surrounding structures as a collection of spiky towers. Through the massive keep doors, is a wide set of stairs leading up past many [[Ironkeeper\|Ironkeepers]] standing guard on plinths. Further in is the hall where the Well of Sorrows sits with towering statues of previous Dark Ones guarding it.
