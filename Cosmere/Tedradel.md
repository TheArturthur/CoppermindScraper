### Foreign Policy and International Relationships

Tedradel’s opinion of Hallandren hasn’t improved much since the [[Manywar\|Manywar]], which saw Hanald, the predecessor of Hallandren, and Tedradel go to war with each other Their opinion of Hallandren is low enough that [[Yarda\|Yarda]] considers it possible that Tedradel would go to war with Hallandren again, should Idris be attacked.

## History
### Establishment
Tedradel was established at an unknown date before the [[Manywar\|Manywar]].

### Tensions with Hanald
A little more then three hundred years before the [[Pahn Kahl rebellion\|Pahn Kahl rebellion]], a short time before the Manywar, tensions with [[Hanald\|Hanald]] were at an all time high. This was because of two main reasons.
Hanald had a monopoly on the dye trade, which, at the time, was one of the most profitable trades. Other kingdoms, including Tedradel, wished to profit from this trade as well, but Hanald didn’t allow them to.
Hanald also turned its attention to the relatively new art of [[Awakening\|Awakening]]. During this time they gained powerful awakeners and [[Lifeless\|Lifeless]], which other kingdoms didn’t have. Many different discoveries were made during this time, including the command to make Lifeless with a single breath and [[Ichor-alcohol\|Ichor-alcohol]]. These discoveries allowed nations to build far larger and cheaper armies, and become far more powerful, raising tensions even higher.
At some point, one of the [[Returned\|Returned]] in Hanald had a vision of war. This ended up being the catalyst for a war, as it prompted [[Strifelover\|Strifelover]] to strike preemptively against the other nations.

### The Manywar
Soon after [[Kuth\|Kuth]] and [[Huth\|Huth]] were attacked, Tedradel was dragged into the war, opposing [[Hanald\|Hanald]]. It is unknown if they joined the [[Pahn Unity\|Pahn Unity]], although they did fight on the same side. sometime after the destruction of Kuth and Huth Strifelover withdrew his phantoms, taking back control of his own kingdom. He then made peace with the remaining kingdoms, including Tedradel. However, since the Manywar, Tedradel's hatred and animosity towards Hallandren has not lessened greatly.
