## Appearance and Personality
He is a short, completely bald man with pallid skin and eyes that make him appear [[Shin\|Shin]] to Rosharans, likely indicating a lack of . He walks with a hunched posture and wears a hooded cloak to hide his appearance.

## Attributes and Abilities
Sixteen lives in a small box near the statue garden in Lasting Integrity. He leaves his home every sixteen days, a practice that amuses the [[Honorspren\|honorspren]] due to its consistency. His motivation for this routine is unknown, but when he leaves his house he brings no food or waste out of or into it, and the spren do not believe that he ever bathes.

## History
Sixteen is from Scadrial, but it is unclear how or why he came to live in Lasting Integrity. The local [[Spren\|spren]] find him odd, but they do not mind having him around; he seems to have very little interaction with anyone.
When [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] came to Lasting Integrity hunting [[Restares\|Restares]], she suspected that Sixteen was the man she was looking for. When the day came for Sixteen to leave his house, Shallan sat outside waiting for him to emerge. When he left, he moved in a furtive, hurried fashion through the statue park near his home. When he stopped to look at some notes, Shallan accosted him and his hood fell. Shallan quickly realized that Sixteen's appearance did not match [[Mraize\|Mraize's]] description of Restares. He shouted, then spoke to Shallan in a language that she did not recognize before he fled back into his house. Shallan later briefed Mraize on the encounter; he believed it very unlikely that Sixteen was Restares in disguise, but he did not completely rule it out.

## Trivia
> [!info] This page or section deals with theories or speculation.Please read carefully and note that this is not necessarily canonical.

Given Sixteen's origins on Scadrial and the fact that he does not seem to eat or drink, fans have speculated that he is a magical being of some kind (such as a [[Cognitive Shadow\|Cognitive Shadow]] or a [[Kandra\|kandra]]) or that he can somehow subsist solely on [[Investiture\|Investiture]]. However, Brandon has provided very limited information when asked about him.
