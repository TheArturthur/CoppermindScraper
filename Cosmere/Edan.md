## Appearance and Personality
He is lean and balding. He often appears fidgety and nervous, and has a tendency to blurt things out and interrupt the flow of conversation. He is known to be wasteful and alternates between worrying about his financial problems and ignoring them in hopes that they will somehow disappear. His name is based on [[/wiki/Aon#Eda]], which means "superior or lofty".
He is primarily concerned with self-preservation and admits to beating the peasants in his plantation to try and coax more production from them. His attitude towards [[Sarene\|Sarene]] indicates a degree of misogyny. [[Kiin\|Kiin]], [[Lukel\|Lukel]], and [[Ahan\|Ahan]] all dislike him, and he is thought of as spineless and arrogant.

## History
Edan was the baron of [[Tii Plantation\|Tii Plantation]], which primarily grew potatoes. Tii Plantation contained most of the [[Chasm\|Chasm]] and the infertile land surrounding it, and Edan had never been particularly rich. Edan was a staunch supporter of [[Raoden\|Raoden's]] efforts to undermine King [[Iadon\|Iadon]] due to his inability to maintain power in Iadon's wealth-based caste system. In an effort to make more money, Edan made some questionable investments that were unsuccessful, leaving him nearly bankrupt and in danger of losing his barony within a few months. He continued to live in relative extravagance to hide his true financial situation.
Edan was among the few nobles who attended a meeting of Raoden's former supporters organized by Kiin and Lukel after Raoden was taken by the [[Shaod\|Shaod]]. Edan was very nervous about his future and Ahan mocked him mercilessly. Although Edan was dubious of Sarene's plan to increase the morale of Arelon's citizens, he went along with her suggestions as he had no other options. When Sarene later suggested that the group should side with Elantris, Edan was taken aback, but was unable to argue with Sarene's logic.
Tii Plantation commenced its planting for the season, but rain in the area caused mudslides in the fields. Edan presumably abandoned any remaining hope of maintaining his barony and fled to [[Duladel\|Duladel]]. Lukel pointed out that the Dulas would not care about Edan's former nobility and he would likely end up as a farmer.
Despite the lack of resources in Tii Plantation, a number of minor nobles attempted to gain Edan's former title from Iadon. Raoden used this as part of his cover story when he posed as "Kaloo".

## Trivia
One of the purposes of Edan's character is to serve as a red herring to distract the reader from the actual traitor, Ahan.
