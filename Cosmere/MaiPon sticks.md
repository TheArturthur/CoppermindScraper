**MaiPon sticks** are an eating utensil used in [[JinDo\|JinDo]]. Based on the name, they likely originated in [[MaiPon\|MaiPon]]. They come in pairs, with one stick having a sharp pointed tip and the other having a flat shoveled end.
[[Sarene\|Sarene]] had never used MaiPon sticks before arriving in [[Arelon\|Arelon]], and had trouble eating with them when [[Kiin\|Kiin]] made [[HaiKo\|HaiKo]] for her first meal in Arelon. [[Kaise\|Kaise]] found this to be unbecoming of a princess.
Something similar to MaiPon sticks are used in both [[Torio\|Torio]] and [[Nagadan\|Nagadan]] on [[Komashi\|Komashi]]; when telling the story of [[Yumi\|Yumi]] and [[Painter\|Painter]], [[Hoid\|Hoid]] refers to them as MaiPon sticks for the convenience of his audience.
