## Appearance and Personality
Govenor Varlance is a military man who wears a cravat and regularly applies ghostly white powder to his face, as is the fashion as of the year 346 [[Catacendre\|PC]]. He is comes across to some as a haughty individual who often is preoccupied with his war medals and is viewed by some as being a pushover. For parts of his term as Govenor of Elendel, he leans heavily on his Vice Govenor [[Adawathwyn\|Adawathwyn]], and others. He initially appears to be somewhat uninformed of what the committees and his own authority are capable of. However; he soon becomes quite decisive in delegating tasks and responsibilities to those who are capable, as shown when he fires [[Adawathwyn\|Adawathwyn]] from the position of Vice Governor, and makes [[Steris\|Steris]] the city's Disaster Preparation Officer.

## History
### Early Life
Prior to his term as Governor of Elendel, Varlance was a military man. He was awarded several medals for his service, though it was not widely known what the medals were awarded for, or how he got them.

### As Governor of Elendel
During his term as Governor, Varlance spends the majority of his time focusing on publicity, park re-dedications and sitting in on Senate meetings. He was comfortable allowing [[Adawathwyn\|Adawathwyn]] be the primary voice of his office. However, as [[Elendel\|Elendel]] is threatened by the [[Set\|Set]] with a bomb from [[Bilming\|Bilming]], he begins to take advice from [[Steris\|Steris]] on how to effectively evacuate the city and grants her the authority needed to keep the city safe from the impending explosion and tsunami.. After the attack on Elendel is resolved and rebuilding begins, Varlance fires Adawathwyn, and subsequently hires Steris as Elendels Disaster Preparation Officer.
