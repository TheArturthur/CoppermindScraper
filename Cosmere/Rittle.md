## History
### The Skaa Rebellion
Rittle was recruttied to [[Kelsier\|Kelsier's]] army, and was present to watch [[Demoux\|Demoux]] fight against [[Bilg\|Bilg]].

### The New Empire
He was on guard with [[Wellen\|Wellen]] on the night that [[TenSoon\|TenSoon]] impersonated [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]]. He was shocked and afraid to see "Kelsier", although he asked him why had sent the [[Mist\|mists]] to kill them and he did not want to divulge information about King [[Penrod\|Penrod]]. He told TenSoon that no one knew [[Vin\|Vin's]] whereabouts. TenSoon went on to tell Rittle and Wellen to lead people out of the city due to impending disaster.
Rittle, Wellen, and a small group of other people that saw TenSoon set an evacuation into motion that resulted in hundreds of thousands of refugees heading to the [[Pits of Hathsin\|Pits of Hathsin]]. Rittle and Wellen were asked to speak to [[Demoux\|Demoux]] and [[Elend\|Elend]] to verify their account of Kelsier. Rittle told Elend that he was certain they had seen Kelsier, although Elend noted that he had not left his best soldiers behind when he left Luthadel, and that Rittle did not look like a reliable witness. However, Rittle was insistent that he recognized Kelsier; he had converted to the Church of the Survivor on the day of Kelsier's death and he had seen him in person at the [[Arguois caverns\|Arguois caverns]] on the day that Demoux fought [[Bilg\|Bilg]]. Elend was still somewhat skeptical of his account, but believed that Rittle and Wellen were heroes anyway given the turmoil in Luthadel.
