## Appearance
The *Crow's Song* is a fine, expensive merchant ship. It is four-masted ship; the equivalent of a small galleon. It has four levels: the upper deck, exposed to the sky; the middle deck, which contains the mass, armory, and officers' quarters; the lower deck, a cramped space where most of the crew sleeps; and the hold, which stores any cargo the ship may be carrying. There are several bathrooms on various decks. It has two cannons: one on its aft deck and one on its foredeck. Except for the [[Sprouter\|sprouter's]] quarters, which are lined with aluminum, the entire ship has silver lining the floor. It is faster than most ships on Lumar. 

## History
### Before Tress
The *Crow's Song* began as a legal merchant ship. Sometime before the events of *Tress*, Crow convinced the crew that unless they turned to piracy, they would be enlisted to serve in an impending war. She also told them that they would not kill and become [[Deadrunner\|deadrunners]] unless under attack. Instead, they extort merchant ships and take their goods, thus filtering the money from them back into the economy. However, Crow intended to break that promise, as becoming deadrunners would ensure the crew's loyalty and force them to sail the [[Crimson Sea\|Crimson Sea]] with her so she can find the [[Dragon\|dragon]] [[Xisisrefliel\|Xisisrefliel]] and cure her affliction. She also recruited cannonmaster [[Laggart\|Laggart]] to her cause, and he made false compartments in the bottom of the *Crow's Song's* cannons, in which he stored a destructive type of cannonball that he would switch out for the normal one during a battle. The ship's sprouter, [[Weev\|Weev]], was also helping Crow, but when he started blackmailing her she had him thrown off the ship under the guise of him refusing to turn pirate.

### Sailing the [[Verdant Sea\|Verdant Sea]]
When Tress is stowing away on the *Oot's Dream*, Crow and Laggart attack it during a break in the [[Seethe\|seethe]], using the destructive cannonball to put a hole in the *Oot's Dream’s* hull. Tress escapes with [[Huck\|Huck]], then walks across the spore sea to the *Crow's Song* before the seethe lets up. When Tress climbs on board the ship, Crow orders her thrown overboard, but she proves her worth scrubbing the deck and the order isn’t brought up again. Crow tries to leave one of the *Oot's Dream’s* crew alive to spread the word of her crime, but he dies anyway.
Tress ends up assigned to filling the cannons with spores when she discovers the false bottom in the forecannon and the cannonball inside. She quickly figures out that Laggart must have tried to sink the other ship. She has Huck spy on Crow and Laggart, and he confirms her theory, figuring out that Crow and Laggart want to force the crew to sail "dangerous seas". Tress intends to use this knowledge to escape the ship, since she is a surviving member of the *Oot's Dream,* but decides against escaping, instead opting to help the crew and become the ship's new sprouter.
Tress covertly replaces Laggart's secret cannonballs with ordinary ones, so when they attack another ship, the cannonball splashes water on it and the spores below it instead, and verdant vines grow over it, immobilizing it. Unfortunately, the [[Seethe\|seethe]] stops at just the wrong time, and the captive ship puts a cannonball through the *Crow's Song's* prow. Crow shoots the opposing ship's cannonmaster, and Tress and [[Ann\|Ann]] patch the hole in the prow with [[Roseite\|roseite]]. Crow threatens the crew of the other ship into paying her a hefty bounty, and the *Crow's Song* sails on.

### Sailing the Crimson Sea
 by  Marie Seeberger 
[[Salay\|Salay]] becomes convinced that Tress is a [[King's Mask\|King's Mask]], and invites her to a meeting with Ann and [[Fort\|Fort]]. Tress figures out Crow's motivation, and decides that the best thing for everyone is to sail the Crimson Sea and let Crow be healed by [[Xisis\|Xisis]]. Unfortunately, Tress doesn't know that Xisis requires a servant in exchange for his boon, and that Crow is planning to trade Tress to him. However, after a failed attempt at mutiny, Tress figures out that *she* can trade *Crow* to the dragon instead. This works, and Tress becomes captain.
On Huck’s instruction, Hoid throws barrels of food overboard to prevent Tress and the *Crow's Song* from sailing to the Sorceress’s island. It doesn’t work, since the crew agrees to eat verdant vines instead.

### Sailing the [[Midnight Sea\|Midnight Sea]]
Tress sets out on her own towards the Sorceress's island and gets captured. Meanwhile, Fort makes a deal with the [[Midnight Essence\|Midnight Essence]]: he would supply it with water if it let the *Crow's Song* pass to [[Riina\|Riina]]’s island. This works, and they arrive just in time to rescue Tress. Ann immobilizes Riina’s metal golems, allowing [[Hoid\|Hoid]] to enter the tower and rescue Tress. 
A few months later, Tress sells the *Crow's Song* and gets the crew pardoned by the king. She buys a new ship called The *Two Cups*, which has the same crew as the *Crow's Song,* plus Charlie as valet, storyteller, and musician.

### Dougs
The *Crow's Song* had an additional 52 crewmembers, who [[Hoid\|Hoid]] did not feel were important enough to his telling of *Tress of the Emerald Sea* to name individually, and they are therefore referred to as Dougs. He chose to call them all Doug because the name is extremely common throughout the [[Cosmere\|Cosmere]], and because [[Doug\|one of them]] is actually named Doug.
