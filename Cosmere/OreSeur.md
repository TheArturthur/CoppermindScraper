**OreSeur** is a [[Kandra\|kandra]] from [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
His [[Contract\|contract]] is with [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] at first. He mainly imitates Lord [[Renoux\|Renoux]] and keeps an eye on [[Vin\|Vin]] while she acts as Valette Renoux. Upon Kelsier's death, his contract is passed to [[Vin\|Vin]]. She is angry with him because he knew of Kelsier's plan to die and inspire the [[Skaa\|skaa]] to fight, but did not stop it, though OreSeur only acted in accordance with his contract. Eventually, Vin’s disgust at the idea of a kandra eating humans drives her to order OreSeur to ingest the bones of a wolfhound instead. Mid-transformation, he is secretly killed and replaced by [[TenSoon\|TenSoon]].
His contract is assigned to [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] by [[KanPaar\|KanPaar]] even though it would be to act against the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]], due to the high price Kelsier was willing to pay for it. Being a rather rebellious member of the Third Generation, OreSeur is one of the few kandra willing to accept this job, and he leaves the [[Kandra Homeland\|Kandra Homeland]] after a long period of retirement to do it.
Like [[TenSoon\|TenSoon]], he is of the third generation of Kandra and was thus over 700 years old at the time of his death.

## Trivia
Brandon wanted to write a short story from OreSeur's perspective to explore the kandra's motives for taking Kelsier's contract, as well as his feelings after [[Rashek\|Rashek]] was killed.
