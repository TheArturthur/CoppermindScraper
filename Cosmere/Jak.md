## Appearance & personality
Jak is depicted in all his broadsheets as being a well groomed man around his early thirties. He is always shown sporting a large mustache which is complimented by long hair and glasses. Although his outfit varies from time to time it almost always bares a resemblance to a suit of some kind with a [[Mistcloak\|mistcloak]] added. The mistcloak seemingly serves no purpose since Jak is not known to be a [[Coinshot\|coinshot]] or [[Lurcher\|lurcher]]. When in less formal settings and outside exploring he is also depicted as wearing a cowboy hat. Jak also has frequently wears buttoned up shirts, which apparently have a tendency to break open as his stories go on, underneath of which he is shown to have a well muscled physique.
It can be difficult to understand what Jak's personality is like as the depiction of him in his adventures and the opinions of those around him diverge greatly. As depicted by himself Jak is shown to be a crafty and courageous individual who displays little to no fear at the variety of threats that face him. He is shown to be competent and capable of escaping a wide array of dangerous scenarios using his smarts alone. Being both well cultured and travelled he also has little issues getting along with those whose paths he crosses during his ventures. In contrast to this however his closest peers give a different account of both his personality and adventures, according to his editor and [[Terris\|Terris]] steward, [[Handerwym\|Handerwym]], Jak is in fact quite ignorant about the events he writes about. Handerwym attests that Jak does little in the way of true research or in double checking his accounts for accuracy, not even for grammar mistakes or continuity. Most of these errors are rectified by Handerwym come the publication of the book editions of his journeys with biting commentary given in the form of footnotes also added to provide a more accurate account of events. While refraining from outright stating that Jak lies in his adventures Handerwym displays a large amount of doubt about his more outlandish claims. From these footnotes a different image of Jak is painted in which he appears more idiotic than brave during his adventures, it seems a common occurance for him to completely misunderstand what is happening and instead consistently escalating situations. Despite this, and the many improbable claims that Jak makes, he himself does not actually think he is lying whilst recounting his stories.

## Attributes and Abilities
Jak is a [[Tin\|tin]] [[Misting\|Misting]] (aka a [[Tineye\|Tineye]]) who is apparently skilled at using his abilities to help assist him in seeking out important information. He also is proficient in a gun that he wields which he named **Glint**. Jak also seemingly has a good skill in animal handling as he claims to have managed to domesticate a 'long necked' animal from the [[Roughs\|Roughs]]. The animal in question being either a  or a .

## History
 by  Ben McSweeney  [[Elizandra\|Elizandra]] finding Jak
### Early Adventuring
Jak began his adventuring career sometime around the year 319 PC, his stories initially received great success and acclaim with stories about him reaching as far as the Roughs. He was noted due to the claim that he had never killed a criminal yet and instead arrested them.
Over the years Jak would eventually leave the roughs and begin exploring more distant and dangerous locations. He was thrown into the ocean in *Allomancer Jak and the Mask of Ages* while tied to a bust of the [[Survivor\|Survivor]] (or the [[Spook\|Lord Mistborn]]). He claims to have swum through river rapids in *Allomancer Jak and the Waters of Dread*, although this may not have actually happened. He also at some stage climbed the ashmounts and domesticated a long necked animal.

### The Pits of Eltania
During a later adventure Jak ventured to the [[Pits of Eltania\|Pits of Eltania]] in search of the Survivor's treasure. He at one stage believed he was to be executed for some unknown transgression against the local koloss tribe. Before being executed Jak was allowed to say goodbye to his acquaintances. Jak managed to recover his gun from [[Handerwym\|Handerwym]] while embracing him. Jak used the gun to escape his bonds and kill his executioner. Jak then resolved to be accepted by the koloss tribe as one of their own, he also came to believe that he was now king of the tribe.
He would be challenged by a koloss and managed to kill them with his gun. This was apparently part of his plan to be accepted by the koloss tribe but Handerwym felt it was not a good one. Jak would later wake up alone in a cave within a canyon and believed himself trapped there. After searching for an exit he would eventually decide to dive into a river below him. He then managed to exit the river near a group of koloss. The group brought him over to their tribe leaders who offered to make Jak into a koloss believing him to be worthy of joining the tribe, Jak also discovered that his girlfriend, [[Elizandra Dramali\|Elizandra Dramali]] is koloss blooded and herself a previous member of the tribe. Dramali tries to explain the process to Jak so he can choose but he interrupts her and devises a plan to not be made into a koloss. Jak proclaims that he is already a koloss and that he will prove it by recovering the survivors treasure from the bottom of a lake. He was successful in this endeavour and the koloss were pleased to discover a cache of Hemalurgic spikes within it. Jak then discovered the box containing the spikes was made of aluminium, pleased with the find he left the tribe with Elizandra. They would later have to go back upon realising they had forgotten Handerwym and had left him behind.

### New Seran
 by  Shuravf  With [[Elizandra\|Elizandra]]
During a later adventure Jak would find himself at New Seran where Handerwym caught news that criminals were going to replace the alleged buttons of [[Spook\|Spook's]] favorite smoking jacket with forgeries. Deciding to put a stop to this Jak and Handerwym went to an auction for the buttons being held by Lady Lavont. Handerwym was left to keep an eye on the buttons and make sure they were not swapped out with fakes while Jak went off to talk to Lady Lavont and her circle of friends. While doing so a man pulled a gun on Jak claiming he had killed his brother and that he wanted revenge. In an effort to buy time Jak proclaimed that he was unarmed and spun around in a circle to prove his point, then realizing he did not recall killing the man's brother he informed him that he was innocent. The man then realized that he had mistaken Jak for [[Wax\|Wax]], Jak laughed off the mistake and offered to buy him a drink. Before he got the chance however Handerwym arrived and signaled to Jak that the buttons had been stolen.
At a later time Jak made the acquaintance of [[Nicelle Sauvage\|Nicelle Sauvage]] who then started publishing under the Allomancer Jak brand. She would later serve as his assistant during his ventures, a time Nicki considered among the strangest in her life.

### Breakup with Handerwym
In the years following the discovery of the [[Bands of Mourning\|Bands of Mourning]] Jak continued to publish his stories and by happenstance discovered a large amount of Survivor artifacts. Whilst expanding his business Jak decided to invest in new forms of media entertainment and in order to fund these ventures took a stake out of Handerwym's ownership in the company. This led to a public falling out between the two with the judge ultimately siding with Handerwym. Jak continued to be published in *The Sentinel of Truth* while Handerwym kept exclusive access to *The Two Seasons* as well as other papers. Nicelle Sauvage would continue under Handerwym's banner.

## Relationships
### Waxillium Ladrian
[[Wax\|Wax]] much like Jak began his career in the Roughs working to collect money from the various bounties around the region. Jak was his elder in this profession by about 6 years as Wax began this career sometime around 325 PC. Despite this common connection however it appears that the two never got along during the early days, Wax himself states that he found Jak's stories ridiculous and considered him a 'fop' rather than a true lawman whilst Jak on the other hand showed open disdain for Wax stating that he would gladly look forward to shooting him if given the chance. The reason for this animosity is unclear however it would seem that the pair never actually worked together as neither Jak nor Wax ever mention working with the other, notably Wax does not list Jak with the other lawmen he worked with in the Roughs.
Later on however their relationship would slowly improve over time, at least on Jak's end. Following the discovery of the [[Bands of Mourning\|Bands of Mourning]] and the start of Wax's political career Jak would warm considerably to the man and begin mentioning him much more frequently in his writings, insisting that the pair were friends and comrades during past adventures. Wax himself denies this and grows quite frustrated when the connection is mentioned, however he is willingly to play along with the story when needed to comfort someone.

## Publishing
 by  Ben McSweeney 
His sensationalized adventures are published in *The Elendel Daily* and *The House Record*. In the House Record he does insult other newspapers and claims the House Record is superior to them which may suggest some kind of brand deal he has with them. These versions are unedited by Handerwym and as a result are terribly written. Handerwym then takes several episodes and combines them into one volume that he edits and annotates. The annotations generally consist of humorous insults and corrections. A story about [[Nicelle Sauvage\|Nicelle Sauvage]] in *The New Ascendancy* is published under an "Allomancer Jak presents" logo, suggesting that Jak may help publish the stories of other adventurers.
He is known to have published various series, notably *Allomancer Jak and the Mask of Ages*, *Allomancer Jak and the Waters of Dread*, *Allomancer Jak and the Pits of Eltania*, and *Gentleman Jak in the City of Fountains*. Although far more are referenced to, but left unnamed.
*Gentleman Jak in the City of Fountains* is further known to have named episodes, with *Part 5: A Sport of Spirits* and *Part 6: The Sinister Soiree*

## Trivia
Jak appears to be a [[Survivorist\|Survivorist]], as he references the [[Survivor\|Survivor]] providing for him and regards the Survivor's teachings as true. However, he thinks his alleged spirit guide [[Lyndip\|Lyndip]] may be a [[Faceless Immortal\|Faceless Immortal]] (which are part of [[Pathian\|Pathian]] doctrine as noted by [[Handerwym\|Handerwym]]) so his theological depth appears to be limited.
[[Wayne's mother\|Wayne's mother]] and [[Wayne\|Wayne]] himself both claim to be fans of Allomancer Jak and his stories, the latter claiming to have read all of his published adventures.
