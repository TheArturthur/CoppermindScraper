The Captain is tan with matted hair and bad breath. He thinks highly of himself, but does not seem to realize that others do not share this opinion.

## History
The Captain of the *Oot's Dream* was a smuggler who had forged mercantile writs from the [[Verdant King\|Verdant King]] in order to buy and sell goods without paying tariffs. When he picked up a shipment of [[Brick\|Brick's]] ale from [[Diggen's Point\|Diggen's Point]], [[Tress\|Tress]] disguised herself as a royal inspector and demanded passage on the *Oot's Dream* to report to the king. Thinking that Tress was trying to expose their smuggling operation, the Captain ordered for her to be poisoned and locked in the ship's brig. When the *Crow's Song* attacked the *Oot's Dream*, the Captain allowed [[Dorp\|Dorp]] to use Tress to try to stop the attack. The *Crow's Song* did not stop and the Captain of the *Oot's Dream* was killed along with his crew.
