## Appearance and Personality
She looks like a little old grandmother. She wears a shawl and carries an orange handbag. She has shaky legs and her back is bowed with age. She uses a cane to walk.
She is a noted baker; [[Leavenworth Smedry\|Leavenworth Smedry]] said one of the nice things about facing off against her was the treats.

## History
Most people, including other Librarians, cannot pronounce her name, so she is often called **She Who Cannot Be Named.** In his narrative, [[Alcatraz Smedry\|Alcatraz Smedry]] gets annoyed at typing her long nickname and calls her **Swcbn** for short. One of the only people who calls her by her full name is [[Leavenworth Smedry\|Leavenworth Smedry]], and Kangchenjunga claims that he is the only one "out here" (presumably in the Free Kingdoms) who can pronounce it correctly.
Kangchenjunga and Leavenworth have a storied history. She calls him friend, though he refutes the title. Their relationship includes an incident in which Kangchenjunga caught Leavenworth in a trap that left him dangling from a frozen mountain cliff with his foot tied to a slowly-melting block of ice and his body strapped with bacon, stuck with a sign that read "Free Wolf Chow." 
She travels to [[Nalhalla\|Nalhalla]] to oversee a treaty that would end hostilities between the  and the Free Kingdoms in exchange for Librarian control of [[Mokia\|Mokia]]. During the chaos surrounding the eventual tearing up of the treaty, she sits calmly and knits. When her faction is eventually defeated, she finally puts down her knitting, revealing an afghan with a depiction of a bloody skull . She chastises her opponents, and vanishes, being replaced with an exact statue of herself.
She also orders the execution of [[Himalaya Smedry\|Himalaya Smedry]], her former assistant.

## Trivia
Her first name is likely a reference to the mountain  in between Nepal and India. Her last name is likely a reference to the mountain  in Sweden.
