>“*How are the members of each Order different from the members of the others? What kinds of personalities does each Order attract? This is especially interesting in cases where some of the personalities seem to overlap. Why choose one Order over the other? How do you differentiate their similarities?*”

## Personality
Senne's journal is written in an informal rather than scholarly manner. She mentions facts about each Order alongside her own opinions and biases, giving some insight to her personality.
She finds formality and efficiency to be obnoxious, and thus she often finds herself irritated by [[Windrunner\|Windrunners]]. She mentions having caused "destruction" in her past, and thinks that she could have enjoyed being a [[Dustbringer\|Dustbringer]] due to their ability to control themselves and others. She deeply appreciates the [[Edgedancer\|Edgedancers]] for how they bring beauty into the world, and how they assist the poor, sick, and destitute. She believes that it is important to know yourself well, especially if you are an artist. She values people who support and help others, and tries to keep such people close.

## History
In the thirty-first year of the Sixth Epoch, Senne was assigned a task to document the Radiant Orders after initially studying the [[Lightweaver\|Lightweavers]]. Senne was surprised that Hoid selected her to complete the treatise, as she was a brand new apprentice at the time. Senne's own background and how she came to meet Hoid is unknown, but her research is centered on Roshar and she seems to have personal knowledge of each Order.
Senne kept a journal as she researched each Order. Rather than focusing on powers, she tended to explain the archetypal personality of each Order, often commenting on their roles in society and their relationships with other people. Her known journal entries are each dated seven days apart, and cover the Orders in the typical sequence of the numbers associated with them by the [[Ten Essences\|Ten Essences]].
