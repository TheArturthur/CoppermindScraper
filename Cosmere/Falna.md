**Falna** is a planet in the [[High Empire\|High Empire]].
It is an important planet, near the core of the empire, and is home to an imperial fleet. By the end of the [[Reunification War\|Reunification War]], however, the empire's forces were stretched thin, as they had been pushing outward to hold their newly re-expanded borders. As a result, Falna was one of the ten locations [[Varion Crestmar\|Varion Crestmar]] attacked in his rebellion against the empire.
When [[Dennison Crestmar\|Dennison Crestmar]] analyzed the attack on Falna, he correctly predicted that Varion would push the imperial gunships there into retreating, thus breaking their firing lines and opening a gap for his fighters. After the [[High Emperor\|High Emperor]] gave Dennison permission to transmit fake reports of the battles to Varion through a bug in Varion's ** transmitter, Dennison made it look like one of the imperial gunships had gotten off a lucky shot, breaking Varion's fighter line in just the wrong place and allowing the imperial fighters to rally, resulting in an unlikely but not unreasonable defeat for Varion.
