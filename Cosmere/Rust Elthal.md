**Rust Elthal** is an officer and a [[Shardbearer\|Shardbearer]] in [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin's]] army on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Appearance and Personality
Rust is a limber man, and he has a distinguished face with a thin moustache.
As an officer of Dalinar's army, he proves himself to be a competent and loyal leader. Dalinar trusts him with a set of [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]], and with it he becomes a greater asset to the army.

## History
Rust Elthal was part of Dalinar's army on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] during the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]]. He was the senior-most officer to survive the [[Battle of the Tower\|Battle of the Tower]], where he fought close by Dalinar. He injured his arm during the fighting. After the army was rescued by [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]], Dalinar directed Rust to take the wounded back to his warcamp and to tell [[Teleb\|Teleb]] to put the camp on alert.
A few months later, Rust received a set of Shardplate when [[Adolin Kholin\|Adolin Kholin]] won several sets during his duels with the other [[Highprince\|highprinces']] Shardbearers. During the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]], he and [[Serugiadis\|Serugiadis]], under the command of Teleb, fought at the head of Highprince [[Sebarial\|Sebarial's]] army with their Shards. As the [[Alethi\|Alethi]] armies retreated to the [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] at the end of the battle, Rust helped guide some of Dalinar's mechanical bridges into position to span the chasm. He then relocated to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] with the majority of the Alethi warcamps. Rust and Serugiadis practiced with [[Shardbow\|Shardbows]] on the plateau at the base of the tower on the day Dalinar first visited [[Azimir\|Azimir]] to discuss joining the [[Coalition of monarchs\|coalition of monarchs]].
