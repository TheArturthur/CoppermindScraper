**Guillian** is a felon apprehended in [[Elendel\|Elendel]] in 342.
Guillian joined [[Migs\|Migs]] and eight other men to commit some sort of crime, but they were found out and trapped in a building for the entire night. Around dawn, [[Wax\|Wax]] and [[Wayne\|Wayne]] helped the constables capture the men. Wayne sneaked into the room, posing as a robber before knocking out Guillian and taking his ivory-handled knife, Guillian's favorite.
