**Rock** is [[Lunamor\|Lunamor]] and [[Tuaka\|Tuaka's]] second son. He is named after a smaller kind of rock than his father. Per his culture's traditions he has the honor of gathering food.
Rock arrived at the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] with his family in Jes 1174 after traveling for months to meet with Lunamor, who sent them a message shortly after his arrival. Rock's caravan was attacked by [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]] and his family defended themselves behind a pile of furniture. During the attack a member of his family shot a Voidbringer with an [[Unkalaki\|Unkalaki]] arrow. They were found by [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]] during a patrol and taken to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]]. After settling in Urithiru, he helped his father serve food and drink to Bridge Four.
Shortly after the evacuation of the residents of [[Hearthstone\|Hearthstone]], Rock traveled back to the Peaks with most of his family, with just [[Cord\|Cord]] and [[Gift\|Gift]] staying behind.
