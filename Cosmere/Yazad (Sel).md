## Trivia
Yazad may be named after the Zoroastrian concept of ** (Avestan: 𐬫𐬀𐬰𐬀𐬙𐬀), which is known as *yazad* (𐭩𐭦𐭲𐭩‎) in Middle Persian; Brandon has noted that he was influenced by ancient Zoroastrian words for Rose Empire names. Yazata is a word with various uses, but it is most often used to refer to divine beings that are worthy of worship.
