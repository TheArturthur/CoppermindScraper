## Appearance and Personality
Handerwym is often separated from Jak in his adventures, leaving him skeptical as to whether the action as described by Jak actually took place. His annotations are often satirical and express doubt as to whether Jak's descriptions are accurate. He is annoyed at Jak for his terrible grammar and spelling and is extremely annoyed when people buy the stories without his editing. He believes that getting Jak to improve his writing is far more difficult than Jak's adventures in the Roughs. He left [[Elendel\|Elendel]] because the lack of intelligence among the Elendel public was driving him crazy. So, he could either leave or kill himself, the latter of which would violate his pacifist oaths.

## Attributes and Abilities
Handerwym is a [[Duralumin\|Connector]].

## History
### Working with Jak
Handerwym was a steward and companion of the explorer [[Jak\|Jak]] and followed him on his many adventures in the [[Roughs\|Roughs]]. He was also the editor and annotator of the many short stories that Jak published in the [[Elendel Daily\|Elendel Daily]], a difficult job as he once had to remove sixteen superfluous commas from a single page, and Jak was under the impression that [[Koloss\|Koloss]] looks better when spelled Kol!oss. He has saved Jak's life many times.

### Breakup with Jak
In the years following the discovery of the [[Bands of Mourning\|Bands of Mourning]] Jak continued to publish his stories and by happenstance discovered a large amount of Survivor artifacts. Whilst expanding his business Jak decided to invest in new forms of media entertainment and in order to fund these ventures took a stake out of Handerwym's ownership in the company. This led to a public falling out between the two with the judge ultimately siding with Handerwym. Jak continued to be published in the *[[Sentinel of Truth\|Sentinel of Truth]]* while Handerwym kept exclusive access to *[[The Two Seasons\|The Two Seasons]]* as well as other paper's. [[Nicelle Sauvage\|Nicelle Sauvage]] would continue under Handerwym's banner.
