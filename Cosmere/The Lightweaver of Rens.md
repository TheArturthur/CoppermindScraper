***The Lightweaver of Rens*** is an unpublished [[Cosmere\|cosmere]] work set on [[Yolen\|Yolen]]. During Brandon's 2007 rewrite of the [[Dragonsteel (series)\|Dragonsteel series]], he outlined this book as a direct sequel to *[[The Liar of Partinel\|The Liar of Partinel]]* and a prequel to the main Dragonsteel arc. Brandon was ultimately dissatisfied with *Liar*, and so this book was never finished.
Similar to *The Liar of Partinel*, this story is believed to have featured a character named Midius who later becomes [[Hoid\|Hoid]].
