>“*Well, suppose we'd better raise a cup for old Steve, then. Creep though he was, if the Epics finally got 'im, he deserves a proper sendoff.*”
\-Calaka[1]


**Steve** is a resident of [[Babilar\|Babilar]] who is presumably killed in [[Obliteration\|Obliteration's]] attacks the day the [[Reckoners\|Reckoners]] arrive in the city. [[Calaka\|Calaka]] thinks that he is a creep and insinuates either that Steve often slaps people or that he often gets slapped.

## History
Steve attended parties and hung around Calaka, [[Marco (Reckoners)\|Marco]], [[Lulu\|Lulu]], and [[Infinity\|Infinity]] often enough to be an acquaintance of theirs. He was also known to [[Mizzy\|Mizzy]]; at the [[Party in Babilar\|party in Babilar]], she asked if anyone knew where Steve was. Infinity told the group that she thought he was one of the eighty killed by Obliteration a few days before. The group paid tribute to Steve when they heard about his death. [[David\|David]] was shocked by how quickly the Babilarans seemed to move on from the news and astonished at the ensuing revelation of their attitude towards those who fight back against the [[Epic\|Epics]].
