**Darriance** is [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian's]] house butler at the Ladrian mansion in [[Elendel\|Elendel]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
Darriance performs the usual duties of a butler, such as acting as a doorman and taking people's coats. He takes messages and packages for Wax when he is away from the mansion, and [[Ranette\|Ranette]] trusts him enough to leave new equipment with him. Darriance also helps Wax practice using a [[Steel\|steel]] bubble by shooting at him while Wax wears extensive padding and armor.
[[Wayne\|Wayne]] is amused by Darriance's adherence to protocol and is perpetually trying to provoke him, but Darriance just brushes it off. Wayne jokes that Darriance will snap and try to kill everyone someday.
