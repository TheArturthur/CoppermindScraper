**Elmsdel** is one of the outer cities in the southeastern portion of the [[Elendel Basin\|Elendel Basin]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. It is northwest of [[Garmet\|Garmet]], not far from the [[Seran Range\|Seran Range]].
[[Steris\|Steris]] mentions that travel between Elmsdel and [[Rashekin\|Rashekin]] (a city in the northeastern Basin) requires passage through [[Elendel\|Elendel]]; there are no rail lines that bypass the capital. This leads to commerce between the outer cities being subjected to Elendel's taxes twice; once for the rail taxes and then again for entering Elendel. She argues that this is a reason for the discontentment of the rest of the Basin.
[[Waxillium\|Waxillium]] and [[Steris\|Steris]] are married in the penthouse apartment of someone who has moved to Elmsdel for a long vacation.
