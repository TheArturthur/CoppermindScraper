The plantation is owned by [[Themos Tresting\|Themos Tresting]] and the staff at the plantation included other lords and at least two minor [[Obligator\|obligators]], as well as a number of taskmasters and over two dozen soldiers. His plantation was manned by a workforce of several hundred [[Skaa\|skaa]].

On a certain night Kelsier visited Tresting plantation. He entered one of the skaa hovels, where he talked with [[Tepper\|Tepper]] and [[Mennis\|Mennis]] and gave them [[Noble\|nobleman's]] food. Then he heard two women, [[Jess\|Jess]] and her daughter, screaming outside their hovel. Tresting's soldiers were taking the daughter to his manor. Kelsier immediately went to the manor himself, where he killed all the plantation staff, which included obligators, taskmasters, and soldiers. He also burned down the manor, rescuing Jess's daughter in the process.
Some of the plantation skaa then went on their way to join the [[Skaa rebellion\|skaa rebels]] in the [[Arguois caverns\|Arguois caverns]]. Only a few of them actually stayed, with the rest joining other plantations.
