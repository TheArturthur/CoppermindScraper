  **Vorin nations**. In dark red the nations where Vorinism plays a more prevalent role.
**Vorinism** is a monotheistic religion that is practiced primarily in Eastern [[Roshar\|Roshar]], it is one of the primary religions of Roshar. Vorinism is most prevalent in [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]], [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]], [[Kharbranth\|Kharbranth]], [[New Natanan\|New Natanan]] and [[Thaylenah\|Thaylenah]], collectively known as the Vorin kingdoms, and becomes less common further west.
Vorinism is based on belief in one god, known as the [[Almighty\|Almighty]], who created the world and mankind within it, and the Ten [[Herald\|Heralds]] whom he anointed as his emissaries and protectors of mankind.
Vorinism remains culturally and doctrinally diverse concerning many aspects of their faith, with different nations and ethnic groups forming their own religious branches. The creeds of various Vorin denominations generally hold in common the belief in the Almighty and the Heralds, though tend to vary in their gender norms and whether or not they believe the Almighty to be the only god, amongst other factors.
Vorinism flourished in eastern Roshar, becoming the primary faith in the area.

## Etymology
Vorinism is named after an important figure in the history of the faith known for putting together the various tenets and writings of the faith into an organized religion.

## Beliefs
### The Almighty
For more on The Almighty, see [[/wiki/Honor#Influence]].
In Vorin religion, people believe in the [[Almighty\|Almighty]], the force of good and creator of mankind and the Dawnsingers, along with animals and plantlife and Roshar itself. All things are said to exist because of him, and his existence is held to be axiomatic.
The Almighty is thought to be uncreated, all-powerful, omniscient and all-seeing, immortal, omnibenevolent, and all-loving. The glory of Almighty is held to be as such that anyone looking upon him would immediately burn to ash. As such, he is typically represented by the divine prism with ten facets, one for each of the Heralds. He is also represented with the Double Eye of the Almighty, which represents him and the world itself. These appear to be a manifestation of .
The Almighty is believed to be able to see into the future, this is typically seen as deeply immoral and as a manifestation of Voidbinding, but the Almighty is held as the exception to this rule. Thus he is the only being allowed to divine the future.
The Almighty is believed to have ten holy names; including his tenth name, Elithanathile or *He who Transforms*; which is allowed only to be spoken by members of the Ardentia.
It is believed that the Almighty exists within all people, and all things.
Adherents of Vorinism believe that the Almighty is also responsible for sorting out the dead and deciding on their afterlife. To achieve the results one desires, one has to pick a Calling - a purpose in life - and a Glory, an aspect of the Almighty that one strives to emulate. It is believed these talents are granted to one by the Almighty himself, and it is taught that capitalizing and progressing in these talents is the most fundamental way to worship him. He is believed to accept the excellence of all men and women, regardless of what they do.
He is associated with positive change and transformation, ideas held to be sacred in the Vorin religion. It is believed he used the power of change to create the world, and that he gifted mankind their ability to change and grow on a physical, spiritual, and psychological level. He and his decrees are believed to be the determining factor in what is considered good and moral.
Authority is believed to be rooted in connection and closeness to the Almighty, thus, lighteyed individuals claim that they are closer to the Almighty than the darkeyed, and thus are holier than them and have the authority to rule over them. Kings are also thought to have their authority rooted in a divine mandate from the Almighty.
The Almighty is prayed to via burned Glyphwards. It is believed that, by burning the prayer, they send its soul to the Almighty so that it may be heard and acted upon.
The Almighty, like many things in Vorinism, is associated with the number ten, as seen in his ten holy names, the ten Heralds he anointed as his emissaries, and the ten faceted crystal used in his aniconic representations.
Some people are known to conflate the Stormfather with the Almighty, though this is not universally accepted doctrine.

#### Euhemerism
The Almighty is ultimately based on the Shard [[Honor\|Honor]]. Some ardents have tried to reconceptualize their faith after learning of Honor's death, interpreting Honor as merely being an aspect of the Almighty through which He revealed himself, although this position remains heterodox and heretical to more orthodox Vorinism.

### The Heralds
The Heralds were believed to be forces of good which fought against the Voidbringers in one-hundred Desolations. After the hundredth Desolation, the Last Desolation or Aharietiam, they cast away the Voidbringers from Roshar forever. But they continue to fight against them in the Tranquiline Halls, in order to liberate the Halls from them.
Each Herald is an emissary of the Almighty, wielding potent magical powers, as well as the ability to respond to prayers and patronage over a specific part of human experience. Vorinism typically places [[Jezrien\|Jezrien]] and [[Kalak\|Kalak]] as the highest among the Heralds, with others beneath them. Occasionally, either of them are conflated with the [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]], who in turn is commonly equated with the Almighty himself, although this depends on the particular Vorin country.

### The Voidbringers
The [[Voidbringers\|Voidbringers]] are taught to be the polar opposite of the Almighty, forged in Damnation by the cosmere itself, to act as a balancing force of evil to his goodness. They are said to have cast humanity out of the Tranquiline Halls and to Roshar, and they tried to cast humanity even out of Roshar. They are claimed to still live in the Tranquiline Halls, where the Heralds lead the souls of the fallen against them in the War for Heaven. The Voidbringer incursions onto Roshar are known as the Desolations.
While it is taught that the Voidbringers left Damnation and inhabit the Tranquiline Hills, it is also taught that they exist within Damnation to torture the souls of the damned. Some Vorins have pointed out the contradiction inherent in these teachings.
They are said to be led by the [[Unmade\|Unmade]]. Who are able to watch humanity, and effect their lives. Therefore Vorin people have formed superstitions about what they believe brings the eyes of the Unmade upon them.

#### Folklore
Voidbringers appear not only in theology, but are also prevalent in folklore. Some folk tales in rural areas teach of them as being mischievous beings who steal from the unlucky and punish the foolish; whilst others teach of them disguising themselves as wary travelers, and killing whoever takes them into their home. People in more urban areas speak of them invading the hearts of men and forcing them to do terrible things. They are sometimes conflated with the Lost Radiants. Orthodox Vorinism, however, disagrees with these notions and asserts that the Voidbringers no longer exist on Roshar.

### Dawnsingers
The [[Dawnsingers\|Dawnsingers]] are an ancient race said to have been created by the Almighty and sent to Roshar has healers, to care for mankind after the Expulsion. They are thought of as a type of spren. Ardents reject the idea that the Dawnsingers created the Dawncities or the Veil, though such theories are popular amongst more lay members of the faith.
It is taught that both glyphs and letters are from the Dawnsingers.

### Three-world cosmology
The Vorin cosmology proposes a division between the upper world, the Tranquille Hills; a central world, Roshar; and the lower world, Damnation. These worlds are inhabited by different beings and fulfill different roles in the Vorin cosmological, spiritual, and moral framework.
Alongside these three worlds, they also believe in the Cognitive Realm, though it is unclear where it fits in their cosmology. Furthermore, they believe in a pool of divine essence from which souls are formed. It is unclear where it fits into their cosmology, or if it is the Almighty himself.

#### Tranquiline Halls
For more on the Vorin concept of the Tranquiline Halls, see [[Tranquiline Halls\|Tranquiline Halls]].
A paradisiacal realm close to the Almighty, and the original homeland of humanity before their were cast out of it during the Expulsion. It is believed to be where virtuous humans return to after death, in order to assist in the efforts to expel the Voidbringers from the Tranquiline Halls and cast them back down to Damnation. Those that live a virtuous life but don't reach their potential in their Calling are brought to the Halls, but left in a long and dreamless sleep until the War for Heaven is won. Soldiers are glorified within the Halls, as they are the ones who fight in the War for Heaven.
Life in the Tranquline Halls, before the Expulsion, is thought to be without conflict.
The Tranquiline Halls are often conflated with the [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual Realm]], and it is considered a realm of pure truth.

#### Roshar
For more on Roshar, see [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
For more on the Physical Realm, see [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]].
The material world, made up of the world under mankind's feet and the skies above. This is the world that mankind is born into and lives their life within, with Vorins attempting to live a virtuous life in order to be granted paradise and salvation in the Tranquiline Halls when judged by the Almighty after their death. Life on Roshar is taught to be one of conflict. It correlates with the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]].
Roshar, and all of the plants and animals upon it, are seen as creations of the Almighty.
The nature of Roshar is modeled and described through the Ten Essences and Ten Surges.
It is possible that they see the Cognitive Realm as another aspect of Roshar. They see it as more fluid than the Spiritual Realm, and believe that it can be visited.

#### Damnation
For more on the Vorin concept of Damnation, see [[Damnation\|Damnation]].
A realm of eternal fire that is home to Voidbringers and the souls of the sinful. It is separated into countless rooms in which the souls of the damned are imprisoned to be tortured with ironic punishments tailored to one's own particular vices. The torture is said to be at the hands of the Voidbringers.
It is said to be home to demons, monsters, and evil spren. All three are often conflated with the Voidbringers, depending on which adherent describes them.

### Gender
They believe that men and women have specific stations in life, and must follow a strict set of gender norms.
Ardents are considered effectively genderless from a social perspective, and thus they can engage in the norms of either recognized gender. Though they ultimately tend to be societally pushed to follow their assigned gender.
It is unclear how essential they believe gender to be.

### Life After Death
Those who grow to be the very best at their Calling are chosen to join the Heralds in the fight to regain the Tranquiline Halls when they die. Their particular afterlife differs depending on the Calling -- those who were the very best at farming become farmers for the Heralds, those who are the greatest at battle are chosen to fight beside the Heralds, etc. Depending on what your calling was in life, you would receive powers in the afterlife. A farmer would be able to cause whole fields of crops to grow with a single gesture, a spearman could create thunder with his shield and lightning from his spear.
The Heraldic Forces were believed to be the army of the [[Herald\|Heralds]] that fought the [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]] for the [[Tranquiline Halls\|Tranquiline Halls]] in what was called the War for Heaven. It was said that the sound of a horn would call the Heraldic Forces to the field of battle. Joining the Heraldic forces was the considered to be highest Calling of men.
Those who do not achieve their greatest potential are stuck in a dreamless sleep until the Halls are reconquered, while those who do horrible things are cast into Damnation.
What passes into the afterlife is said to be the mind, with the spirit returning to the divine essence from which it was formed. The mind, spirit, and body are taught to be the three aspects of a being, which are separated upon death.
They appear to have some awareness of the Spiritual Realm, but conflate it with the afterlife.

### Aspects of Being
Vorinism teaches of a tripartite structure of the self. It is said to be made up of the body, mind, and spirit. The mind and spirit appear to be conflated and referred to as the soul.

#### The Body
The body is the vehicle through which the mind and spirit are able to interact with the physical world. It is said to be left behind after death, in order to be reused.
The body appears to be animated by the soul, and can be impacted by damage to the soul.

#### The Soul
Vorinism appears to teach about a bipartite soul which passes into either the Tranquline Halls or Damnation after death, guided by a mythical horn. It is made up of the mind and spirit. The soul is seen as the essence of a person or thing. Everything has a soul, even inanimate objects. It is believed that the soul can be corrupted by evil thoughts and deeds, and thus ardents exist to save and guide them, to protect people from Damnation.
The soul is the animating force of the body, and when severed by a Shardblade, one loses the ability to move their body past the point of severance. If certain points of the soul are severed, such as the neck, the body dies and the soul is released. However, they believe that Shardblades do not truly destroy the soul, even when it severs it, and thus those killed by Shardblades can still pass into the afterlife.
The soul is apparently split into mind and spirit. The spirit is said to be made up of divine essence, and to rejoin this pool upon death; while mind goes to be judged by the Almighty, to pass into the Tranquiline Halls or Damnation. Their individual properties, or the manner in which these aspects interact, is not currently known. Though they are known to be able to exist separately from one another.
The soul is what is believed to be what one improves and transforms through virtuous actions, and through following their Glory and Calling. It is also where mankind's dual-nature resides, allowing them to commit both good and evil actions, shaping their self through those actions.
When a prayer is burned, it is believed its soul is taken to the Almighty for him to hear and respond to.
Vorinism teaches of something called the Soul's March, though little is known about what this describes.

### Belief in Symmetry
Symmetry is considered holy in Vorinism. Among others, [[Glyph\|glyphs]] are shaped symmetrically, [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]] have perfectly symmetrical names, the heralds have symmetric names, and many people's names are close to symmetrical. However, people who have names that are actually symmetric are looked down on as "too holy" and therefore blasphemous. Even the Double Eye of the Almighty, which represents the Almighty and the world itself, is designed with two-fold symmetry.

#### Importance of Opposites
This belief in symmetry also extends to a metaphysical dimension. Vorinism teaches that, as the Almighty and his goodness exists, so too must an opposite force as evil as he is good. It is this necessity for symmetry that led to the birth of the Voidbringers as a rival evil to his good. The belief in opposites can also be seen in the dichotomy between the Tranquiline Hills and Damnation.

### Temples
Traditional Vorin temples are circular and domed, with a sloping mound in the center. Usually, the dome is exactly ten feet tall at its highest point. They are often filled with statues and pictures of the Heralds. A major city is expected to have a separate temple for each Herald. Additionally, wealthy lighteye families will often have private chapels, and the ardentia maintains monasteries throughout the continent. Such monasteries, like [[Jokasha Monastery\|Jokasha]], are often seen as highly desirable postings, with many ardents working decades to get into one.

### Ten Essences and Surges

For more information on the Essences, see [[Ten Essences\|Ten Essences]].
For more information on the Surges, see [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]].
The Ten Essences are a Vorin framework for understanding the nature of reality and of Soulcasting. They are described as classical elements. Each Essence is associated with a [[Polestone\|polestone]], a body focus, its soulcasting properties, a Herald, the attributes associated with that Herald, and a number, amongst other associations. The Ten Essences have their foundation in Soulcasting, and what soulcasted materials are associated with what polestone.
Each Essence is also associated with a Surge, seen as the fundamental forces of reality in Vorin theology. These forces are Adhesion, Gravitation, Division, Abrasion, Progression, Illumination, Transformation, Transportation, Cohesion, and Tension. There appears to be an association between various forces, reflected in the Double Eye of the Almighty.
Essential Theology is likely a collection of precepts and teachings that revolve around the Ten Essences, and is studied by ardents, scribes, and Soulcasters.

### Prayer
Vorin pray through [[Glyphward\|glyphwards]], prayers written in glyphs, typically on a strip of paper, calling on the Almighty and, sometimes, one or more of the Heralds. They are typically burned to carry the soul of the prayer to the Almighty.
In higher classes of [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]], much of the religious observation falls to the priesthood, the [[Ardent\|Ardentia]], rather than the lighteyes themselves. The ardents in the employ of a lighteye are supposed to perform the required rituals for their master, so that the lighteyes do not have to worry about the spiritual aspect of their lives.

### Oathgates
The original purpose of the [[Oathgate\|Oathgates]] has been lost to time, though they are still considered sacred. In the present day, it's believed that the eleven lamps stand for the ten [[Silver kingdoms\|Epoch Kingdoms]] and the [[Tranquiline Halls\|Tranquiline Halls]], while the huge keyhole is "the need for ardents to ignore borders, and look only at the hearts of men".
Thaylen Vorinism describes the Oathgates as "portals of worlds", which only the Passionate could use.

### Scripture
Vorin doctrine holds [[The Arguments\|The Arguments]] as their holy scripture, which acts as a basis of much of their mythology and moral framework. Other texts are held to be of deep religious and cultural importance as well, even if not described as a form of scripture, such as *[[Arts and Majesty\|Arts and Majesty]]*.
During the days of Old Vorinism, *[[The Way of Kings (in-world)\|The Way of Kings]]* was held as a very important and holy religious text. It, however, fell out of use in Vorinism over time. And is no longer used as a holy text within the faith by the Vorin year 1173.

### Social Hierarchy
Social Hierarchy in Vorin nations is seen to be rooted in connection and closeness to the Almighty. Lighteyes are seen as being the chosen of the Almighty, and thus are closer to him than the darkeyed population, and thus are held to be holier than them and are taught to have inherent authority over them. Following from this, kings are thought to have their authority rooted in a divine mandate from the Almighty. It is seen as inappropriate for a darkeyed individual to have authority or wealth above that of any lighteyed individuals. Furthermore, they teach that great wealth is only to be conferred upon one by the Almighty.
Due to their position above darkeyes, it is seen as unthinkable for a darkeyed person to question the orders and desires of a ligheyed person. Thinking or acting outside of one's position, seen as given by the Almighty, is treated as a punishable offence.
This idea, rooted in the Vorin faith, is the foundation behind the strict caste systems in place in various Vorin nations, such as Alethkar and Jah Keved. This caste system, in adherence to these teachings, places darkeyed peoples lower than lighteyed peoples. It has also deeply influenced their worldview, leading them to believe that such caste systems are part of the natural order enforced by the Almighty himself.

### Sacred Numerology
Ten, and multiples thereof, are highly sacred in Vorin theology, appearing in many places in their teachings, scriptures, and practices.
Numerology was historically far more important to Vorin adherents, and they would look for numerological significance in their scriptures. This became an "obsession" and such numerological analysis was eventually banned.
Some examples of ten appearing in Vorin theology include:


The Ten-Faced Crystal used to represent the Almighty
The Ten Essences
The Ten Heralds
The Ten Fools
The Ten Foolish Attributes
The Ten Holy Names of the Almighty
The Ten Silver Kingdoms
The One-Hundred Desolations 
The ten-foot height of traditional Vorin Temples
The ten months in a Vorin year
The ten weeks in a Vorin month
The one-hundred weeks in a Vorin year
The Ten Divine Attributes
The Ten Human Failings
The ten [[Polestone\|Polestones]]
The ten Body Focuses
The Ten Surges

## Moral Teachings
### Good and Evil
Good and Evil, within Vorin Theology, are said to be objective aspects that one possesses. With the Almighty being considered to only possess good, and the Voidbringers being considered to only possess evil. This possession of moral attributes shapes how they act and can act. But humanity has a dual-attribute, meaning they possess both good and evil, and thus can commit both good and evil deeds.
In Vorinism, it is believed that the cosmere requires balance. Good beings, such as the Almighty, must be balanced by their opposites, which is why the Voidbringers were created to do evil. Vorinism holds that only humanity, with their dual-nature, can add good to the world, allowing the amount of good in the world to outweigh the evil.
To live a good life, Vorins are expected to emulate the Attributes of the Heralds and the Almighty. Thus, what is morally right is based upon following the decrees of and the example set by the Almighty. How one chooses to live is seen as far more important than their accomplishments in life. The Ten Human Failings appear to refer to shortcomings of mankind, these might be identical to or associated with the Ten Foolish Attributes.
It is taught that the ligheyes of society were chosen by the Almighty, and inherently have greater Glory and closeness to the Almighty than darkeyes. Furthermore, they are taught to be more honorable, noble, and just than those not as blessed as themselves.
How sinful or virtuous one is can be measured by the Almighty and used to determine whether one goes to the Tranquiline Halls or to Damnation.

### Calling
All Vorins are expected to choose a **Calling**, their greatest talent, granted to them by the Almighty, and practice it until death. However, it seems acceptable for one to choose to change their Calling.
In the Alethi variety of Vorinism, fighting is considered the most important Calling, as the Almighty depends on Alethi to join the Heralds' army in their afterlife and win back the Tranquiline Halls. The ardents are supposed to help someone follow their Calling, helping them to set goals for them to achieve in furtherance of it. When one furthers their Calling enough, they **Elevate**, one goes through multiple Elevations in the pursuance of their Calling.

### Glory
Closely tied to the concept of a Calling is Glory. A Glory is a particular attribute of the Almighty that one is supposed to emulate in the pursuit of their Calling. One typically choses their Glory alongside their Calling, as the two are supposed to work together; for example, the Calling of a warrior and the Glory of determination.
It is seen that Lighteyes have more innate Glory than others, and that the purer their blood, the more they possess.

#### Known Glories

Determination
Denial
Insight
Mercy
Purity
Sincerity
Honesty

### Transformation and Change
Vorinism preaches change and becoming something better. They believe that the ability of mankind to change and grow, making their mind and soul into something better, is one of the Almighty's greatest gifts. This concept forms a core pillar of their doctrine. The power of change and transformation is also held to be holy, and to be one of the greatest powers held by the Almighty. This forms one of the basses of the concept of Callings, Glories, and Elevations; improving oneself through a lifetime of hard work in order to attain one's best self.

### Telling the Future
It is seen that telling the future is an utmost evil, inherently tied to [[Voidbinding\|Voidbinding]].
Due to this, Vorins look down upon gambling and games of chance, seeing them as immoral, heretical, and dangerous.

### Oaths and Marriage

When it comes to relationships, Vorinism is focused on making and upholding oaths. Breaking oaths, or acting without proper oaths, such as having sex outside of marriage, is frowned upon. However, Vorinism offers a wide variety of partnership oaths for those who do wish to pursue relationships, including some for same-sex couples. All official Vorin betrothals must be signed and verified by ardents. As a result, people sometimes use a **causal** betrothal, which makes them practically engaged but confers no legal benefits.
Ardents are permitted to marry, but only within the ardentia.

### Sex and Sexuality
As mentioned previously, premarital sex and adultery are frowned upon, alongside the institution of prostitution. Hand-holding, particularly with the safehand of a woman, is considered very intimate.
Despite their strict adherence to gender roles, they are accepting of homosexual relationships, valuing them as equal to heterosexual relationships.

## Mythology
### Creation Myth and the Expulsion
Vorin doctrine claims that the Almighty created both plants and creatures, including mankind. He too created the [[Tranquiline Halls\|Tranquiline Halls]] and Roshar, through the use of the [[Soulcaster\|Soulcasters]]. Through his goodness, and the creation of good things, the cosmere bore forth the Voidbringers as a rival evil to his goodness. Forged in [[Damnation\|Damnation]], they are regarded as the embodiment of evil, and the polar opposite of the Almighty.
The Vorin creation story places mankind's origins at the Tranquiline Halls, a paradise where they existed for some time, before they they were forced out by the Voidbringers in an event known as the Expulsion. Following the Expulsion, the [[Dawnsingers\|Dawnsingers]] were sent to Roshar to act as guides and healers to mankind.

### The Desolations and the Recreance
The Voidbringers followed humanity to Roshar trying to destroy it or force humanity off it and into Damnation. In order to protect humanity, the Almighty choose ten individuals, likely during [[Proving Day\|Proving Day]], to become his emissaries and leaders of mankind. Mankind, led by the Heralds and their [[Knights Radiant\|chosen knights]], fought them off ninety-nine times in what are known as [[Desolation\|Desolations]]. Between each Desolation experiencing a period of peace. Finally in [[Aharietiam\|Aharietiam]], the Last Desolation, the Voidbringers were defeated and cast back into the Tranquiline Halls. The Heralds followed to force them out of this heaven as well, heralding the Era of Solitude.
On Roshar, the Knights Radiant were left behind, although they ultimately betrayed humankind in the [[Day of Recreance\|Day of Recreance]]. One explanation for the betrayal is that the Knights Radiant imitated great powers and pretended a holy calling using elaborate tricks and once this was discovered they fled. Whatever explanation is given, it is believed that the Knights Radiant betrayed mankind, gaining the moniker of the Lost Radiants.

## Branches and Varieties
Vorinism is known to have at least four branches, the orthodox variety practiced by Alethkar, Jah Keved, and Kharbranth; and the more heterodox varieties practiced by adherents in Herdaz, New Natanan, and Thaylenah. Vorinism has also been syncretized with other religions, such as in the Riran faith, which incorporates Vorin and Iriali teachings.
While culturally and doctrinally diverse, the various denominations and branches have several core similarities, such as a belief in the Almighty and the Heralds.

### Herdazian Vorinism
Herdazian Vorinism is a heterodox variety of Vorinism which varies from the more orthodox variety. Little is known about Herdazian Vorinism, except that their doctrine, contrary to the orthodox, permits male literacy.

### Natan Vorinism
Vorinism practiced by the Natan people also varies from the orthodoxy. Alongside the Almighty and the Heralds, they also worship the moons, with [[Nomon\|Nomon]] as the most important. They believe that these moons are sentient and are able to take human form, and consider two to be female and one to be male. A myth in their faith speaks of how their people were born when an ancient queen named [[Tsa\|Tsa]] had children with Nomon, granting them their blue skin. Thus religious Natan people claim ancestry from Nomon himself. Many Vorin people consider them to be "almost pagan," and question their true devotion.
They believe the moons all grace the night with their light, and call them "Great Celestial Ones" or "Great Ones of the Heavens." Nomon is the most venerated, but Mishim is seen as the most clever. Mishim is believed to always try to escape her duty. Nomon is seen as a masculine figure, whilst Mishim and Salas are seen as feminine.
They believe that when the moons are largest, they pay particularly close attention to the actions of mortals. When not visible in the night sky, they believe that the moons spend their time celebrating, singing songs, and telling stories.
They teach that celestial beings, such as the moons and starspren, speak in a language that would drive mortal men mad.

### Thaylen Vorinism
Thaylen Vorinism is a heterodox form of Vorinism heavily mixed with various local beliefs, such as the [[Passions\|Passions]]. They are considered half-pagan by much of the Vorin world, and Thaylen ardents struggle to prove their piety to orthodox church authorities. Men are permitted to read, and most women use gloves to cover their safehand. Some younger women don't cover the safehand altogether, although this is frowned upon by the more traditional segment of the Thaylen society.
Their branch of Vorinism is heavily mixed with the Passions. Which teaches that wanting something will draw it to you, conflating Passion with Action.
They have their own ideas on what the Oathgates were, describing them as "portals of worlds", which only the Passionate could use.

## Culture
  Vorin woman, with covered safehand on display.
The Vorin religion is closely interwoven with the culture of the Vorin kingdoms, to the point where the same word is applied to both the faith and the culture. Its modern form appears to be based on the book *[[Arts and Majesty\|Arts and Majesty]]*, outlining what is proper for men and women. Women are expected to completely cover their left hand (called [[Safehand\|Safehand]] in Vorin vernacular) from the age of roughly eleven or twelve, as it is generally considered obscene. They are, however, permitted to learn how to read and write, and expected to manage a household and business. Feminine arts include painting, reading, writing, and music. Flutes are a commonly chosen instrument, however, it is rare for side-blown flutes to be found on Roshar. More confrontational positions, such as politics and military, are considered masculine -- however, men are forbidden (or at least discouraged) from learning the alphabet and a man who is literate is considered unseemly. Additionally, Vorinism differentiates between feminine and masculine foods (sweet and spicy). Those division between genders do not apply to ardents, who are considered genderless from cultural standpoint, and thus permitted to engage in both feminine and masculine activities. By tradition, every person can learn a trade at a Vorin temple, including those of the opposite gender.
In addition, the Vorin religion justifies the cultural divide between the [[Lighteyes\|Lighteyes]] and [[Darkeyes\|Darkeyes]], with the former being considered closer to the [[Almighty\|Almighty]] and thus more holy, giving them power over the darkeyed masses.
Vorins are sometimes purposefully named after the Heralds -- for example, [[Shallan\|Shallan]] for [[Shalash\|Shalash]] or [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] for [[Kalak\|Kalak]].
Some aspects of Vorin doctrine are relevant outside of Vorinism itself; for example, Essential Theology, which is related to the [[Ten Essences\|Ten Essences]] and the [[Polestone\|polestones]], is studied by [[Soulcaster\|Soulcasters]] and scholars.


### Proselytization
Vornism appears to support the concept of proselytizing non-Vorins, even supporting doing so through violent means. However it is done, proselytization is seen as bringing pagans to the "Vorin truth."

### Law
Apart from cultural and religious aspect, Vorinism has an impact on the legal system, as the teachings of Heralds demand implementation of certain laws.

#### The Right of Travel
>â*Institute a right of movement, so that a family who feels their lord is unrighteous can leave his area. Then tie a lord's authority to the people who follow him.*â
\-Nale[97]


The Right of Travel allows every Vorin citizen of sixth [[Nahn\|nahn]] or higher to freely travel between various Vorin lands. Vast majority of darkeyes have this right. Lacking it ties a person to the land they were born in, and usually means that something has gone very badly for their ancestors. However, joining the military automatically forfeits the Right of Travel for the duration of service.
The Right of Travel is derived from the [[Herald\|Heralds]] teaching that all borders should be open. More specifically, it was established by [[Nale\|Nale]], as a way to protect the weak from abuses of power. It also serves as a form of addressing the power imbalance between lighteyes and darkeyes, as most darkeyes are able to leave a land that is poorly managed.

#### The Right to Learn
Most people in Vorin kingdoms have the Right to Learn professions in any temple of the [[Almighty\|Almighty]]. Larger Vorin temples have at least one [[Ardent\|ardent]] who is an expert in any given art or trade, and they provide training to anyone who's interested, regardless of eye color.

#### The Right of Challenge
For more information, see [[Right of Challenge\|Right of Challenge]].
The Right of Challenge allows a distinguished lighteyed warrior to demand justice through combat from the one who wronged him. Though the Right is almost never used in the modern day, it can still be exercised, and is well-known among lighteyes. This Right, however, does not extend to darkeyes, and a darkeye attempting to call on it can be punished with execution.

## Priesthood
  <<Kadash\|Kadash>>, a Vorin ardent
The Vorin priests are called **ardents**; the entirety of them is referred to as the **ardentia**. In matters of faith, they are led by a **council of Curates**, operating out of the Holy Enclave in the [[Veden\|Veden]] city of [[Valath\|Valath]]. This council has the authority to excommunicate members of the church, including the leaders of Vorin countries, for heresy -- a right given to them by the Covenants of Theocracy, an unspecified, but centuries-old document. They can be recognized by their blue robes, as well as gem-encrusted staves, far more ornate than is considered proper post-Hierocracy.
Other types of ardents are likewise differentiated by the colors of their robes -- regular ones wear gray, while the [[Soulcaster\|soulcasters]] wear red. Many ardents have shaved heads, and men often have long beards. Both male and female ardents are considered genderless from the social standpoint: women do not need to cover their [[Safehand\|safehand]], while men are allowed to learn to read and write, and both can eat both sweet and spicy foods. This being said, while they are technically allowed to pursue both masculine and feminine arts, they are often pushed to follow their gender. Ardents are permitted to marry, but only within the ardentia.
Ardents are representative of the Almighty, and to disrespect an ardent is considered tantamount to disrespecting the Almighty himself.

### Slavery
Ardents are, technically, slaves to [[Lighteyes\|lighteyed]] nobles of [[Vorin\|Vorin]] countries, with some serving specific households while others are beholden to the national ruler. They can neither hold land nor own property -- a safeguard to prevent a second [[Hierocracy\|Hierocracy]]. Like [[Parshmen\|Parshmen]] and other slaves they are not paid for their work, but they are highly respected, even by people above them in the social hierarchy. It seems one cannot be forced to become an ardent; rather, people join willingly, and can also leave if they so choose.
They believe that the limitations put upon them, and their state of slavery to high ranked political officials, is done by the Almighty as so that they never rise above their stations. They believe that the Highprinces that own them are chosen as the Almighty's guardians of the people.

### Spiritual Guidance
Ardents are forbidden from participating in politics or holding social offices. However, their word and opinions are still highly valued, and they hold authority in spiritual matters.
Ardents are responsible for the spiritual well-beings of their masters, and often tend to various rites and rituals in their stead, so as to allow the [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]] to go on with their lives unburdened. For the [[Darkeyes\|darkeyes]], ardents provide advice in pursuing their Calling, as well as education -- the Right to Learn means that any person who asks for it must be taught by the ardents. For this reason, most major temples have ardents specializing in most common skills, from fighting to writing. This also means that they are allowed to wield [[Shardblade\|Shardblades]], as they must be capable of teaching the lighteyes how to use them.
They are the only people allowed to speak Almighty's tenth name, *Elithanathile*, or He Who Transforms.

### Soulcasting
In [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]], ardents are the only people allowed to use [[Soulcaster\|Soulcasters]]. They surround the practice with mystery, carrying out Soulcasting at night and under heavy guard to prevent the general public from seeing. They are not, however, allowed to use Soulcasters on people. Those among the ardentia who use Soulcasters are often worked until they die of [[Savant\|savanthood]] as their bodies become more and more like the things they Soulcast.

### Devotaries
  <<Ellista\|Ellista>>, a scholar from the Devotary of the Mind
Ardents are separated into Devotaries, sects devoted to different aspects of Vorinism. Devotaries come in different forms: some, like the Devotary of the Mind, are monastic, sequestered away from civilization to devote themselves, while others permit their members to remain in touch with the rest of the world. This being said, ardents are generally not allowed to marry outside of their orders, though at least some orders allow them to marry each other. Overall, their chief purpose is to aid in nurturing the believers' Callings.
Devotaries are dedicated either to a specific Glory, or to a specific Herald.
Known devotaries include:

**The Devotary of Purity** is dedicated to wholesomeness and honesty. Members of this devotary are expected to keep their thoughts and actions 'pure'. A member's talents are expected to be dedicated to purity as well, such as an artist depicting only religious topics. [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] is a member of this devotary, by her father's choice.
**The Devotary of Sincerity** is dedicated to seeking truth in all things. Members believe that there is always something to learn, and everything is subject to scrutiny, even their own religion. No question is rebuked. It is one of the smallest devotaries. In stark contrast to the rest of Vorinism, [[Jasnah\|Jasnah]] respects this devotary, and suggests that Shallan seek it out once she arrives home.
**The Devotary of Insight** is not described. Many ardents from the Devotary of Insight are seen exchanging dulled lamps from the Palanaeum and putting infused ones in their place. They have a temple in Kholinar.
**The Devotary of Denial** seems to emphasize the denial of desires to the point of asceticism.
**The Devotary of the Mind** is a monastic devotary with its home at the [[Jokasha Monastery\|Jokasha Monastery]] on the western slopes of the [[Horneater Peaks\|Horneater Peaks]]. It is devoted to historical and linguistic study, with the focus on literature.
**The Devotary of Mercy** is a devotary with a presence in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]]. Their ardents care for those who have trouble with their minds.
**The Devotary of Kelek** is a devotary with a presence in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]]. Their ardents will take commissions for prayers and glyphwards. This devotary is likely related to the attributes ascribed to Kelek by Vorin tradition.
**The Order of Talenelat** is related to the [[Herald\|Herald]] [[Taln\|Taln]] and, likely, the attributes ascribed to him by Vorinism. Those dedicated to this particular devotary are said to have a dislike for theological debates. It is viewed by some as an order for lesser people. The Order of Talenelat maintains a presence in western [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]], adjacent to the temple of Talenelat. [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] was a follower of this devotary prior to his excommunication.
## History
### Origins and Old Vorinism
Though the origins of Vorinism are lost to the [[Shadowdays\|Shadowdays]], it's known that the name "[[Almighty\|Almighty]]" was used to refer to [[Honor\|Honor]] even back during the [[Desolation\|Desolations]] -- in fact, it might predate human arrival on [[Roshar\|Roshar]], as it was used even by the [[Herald\|Heralds]] themselves. The Vorin religion came about around that time, basing itself on writings of a currently-unknown, but highly influential writer whom it was eventually named after. [[Nohadon\|Nohadon]] was another important figure during that time, and *[[The Way of Kings (in-world)\|The Way of Kings]]* he penned was one of Vorinism's early holy texts.
Back in the early days of the religion, now called **Old Vorinism**, the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] were an important part of the faith, and [[/wiki/Immortal Words#The First Ideal]] was a religious doctrine. The primary tenet of the faith, as far as can be ascertained, was that how one lived was far more important than what one had accomplished. Religion permeated every aspect of life, allowing the ardents to own land and property.

### Hierocracy: Rise
For more information, see [[Hierocracy\|Hierocracy]].
Following the [[Recreance\|Recreance]], the attitudes towards the Knights Radiant changed drastically, with them being seen as traitors rather than heroes. The focus shifted from the First Ideal to other texts, chief among them *[[Arts and Majesty\|Arts and Majesty]]*, leading to the gender divide among the Vorins that exists until the modern day. In spite of that, the [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]]-[[Darkeyes\|darkeyes]] divide likely began during the same time, with pale eyes becoming the symbol of Almighty's favor despite their previous association with Radiance.
As time went on, [[Ardent\|ardents]] took over more and more segments of society, claiming divine mandate to rule. Ultimately, this led to priesthood holding near-absolute power over large swathes of land and populace as they sought to bring Vorinism to the whole of Roshar.
The **[[Hierocracy\|Hierocracy]]**, as it would come to be called, saw the ardentia go to great lengths to control its subjects through access to information. The priesthood claimed to have the sole authority to interpret the holy scriptures and the will of the Almighty; the commoners were to follow them blindly as they were told what their Callings were and what their god had planned from them. Knowledge of the Knights Radiant was heavily censored, and what remained was altered and mythologized to fit the doctrine. Yet even as Surgebinding was discredited and deemed to be mere trickery, ardents themselves claimed to be able to predict the future through visions and prophecies.

### Hierocracy: Fall and Aftermath
  <<Rushu\|Rushu>>, a researcher ardent
For more information, see [[War of Loss\|War of Loss]].
As with many empires, Hierocracy's greatest weakness was its sheer size. It grew larger with time, but so did the fractures within, and those fractures allowed [[Alethkar\|Alethi]] warlord [[Sadees\|Sadees]], later called the Sunmaker, to make war on it. The resulting conflict, known as the [[War of Loss\|War of Loss]], saw the ardentia fractured into devotaries, and the ardents themselves stripped of much of their power. No longer were they allowed to hold land or own property; no longer were they even free men. Rather, they became slaves to [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]].
Moreover, as Sadees conquered their strongholds, he interrogated them and their correspondence, and claimed to have learned that the so-called visions were little more than fabrications made to keep the people in check. This marked yet another shift in Vorin doctrine: now, prophecy was an evil thing, of [[Odium\|Odium]] and the [[Voidbringers\|Voidbringers]], and to pursue it was heresy. Yet more changes were made to free the church from ardentia's grip: rather than holding ultimate authority, they became merely advisors, and each man and woman was supposed to find the faith's meaning for themselves.

### Present and Future
Though Sadees' war of conquest stretched as far West as [[Azir\|Azir]], Vorinism did not find foothold there. On the other hand, the states formerly under Hierocracy, now known as the Vorin kingdoms, retain the faith to this day.
Despite ardentia having few privileges remaining from the days of Hierocracy, their social status has been slowly climbing back up over the past decades. The curates retain their right to excommunicate members of the Church without consulting with any political authority, and though they are forbidden from amassing wealth, some of it still finds its way into their hands. In addition, ardents are increasingly often used as yet another political tool by the lighteyes. Some people -- not only ardents, but even laymen -- seek the return of Hierocracy, chief among them the [[Sons of Honor\|Sons of Honor]]. Other groups, like the [[Envisagers\|Envisagers]], desire to go even further back, to the age of Old Vorinism.
With the coming of the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]] and the return of the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]], the future of Vorinism is unclear. Many of its tenets, chief among them that the [[Aharietiam\|Aharietiam]] was the final Desolation, have been proven wrong, the Heralds are quite mad, and the leaders of the largest anti-Odium faction are a heretic and an atheist. For now, the church strives to retain control through hamfisted means -- most notably, the Curates' sudden excommunication of [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]], who, at the time, had began to loudly proclaim Almighty's death. This is unlikely to be sufficient, however, as there are some who believe that now is the time to break free from Vorinism.

## Trivia
In the English language, the word "ardent" is an adjective meaning eager, zealous or passionate. Etymologically, it derives from the Latin *ardentem*, which is the accusative form of *ardÄns*, the present participle of *ardeÅ* meaning âI burn." This may be an intentional choice, referring to the burning of prayers and glyphwards.
Though "ardent" shares some similarity with [[Arteth\|arteth]], the name of [[Shu-Dereth\|Shu-Dereth]] priests from [[Sel\|Sel]], ardents and arteths are not connected.
Vorinism is inspired by many things, including but not limited to , , ,  and .
Though ardents are around in *[[The Way of Kings Prime\|The Way of Kings Prime]]*, there, they are simply called monks.
