**First of the Sky**, also known simply as **Sky**, is an [[Eelakin\|Eelakin]] [[Trapper\|trapper]] on [[First of the Sun\|First of the Sun]].
First of the Sky made a living trapping [[Aviar\|Aviar]] on [[Patji (island)\|Patji]]. He was an older trapper, and was known to [[Sixth of the Dusk\|Sixth of the Dusk]]. Like other trappers, he carried a notebook in which he recorded his activities; he also kept details regarding the locations of his [[Safecamp\|safecamps]] and the traps surrounding them. He was killed by a [[Tuskrun\|tuskrun]] pack, caught unaware that they had been lured away from their usual movement patterns when a [[Patji's Finger\|Patji's Finger]] tree bloomed. Within a few days, his corpse was reduced to little more than a skeleton by the island's fauna.
His body was discovered by Dusk and [[Vathi\|Vathi]]. Dusk believed that Sky's death was exceptionally unlucky, since he must have stumbled upon the trees just as they were blooming. On the last page of his notebook, Dusk found Sky's brief farewell stating that he has a brother on [[Suluko\|Suluko]]. Sky also requested that the trapper who found his body follow tradition and take care of his Aviar.
When Dusk believed that he and Vathi would need to part ways, he gave her Sky's journal as well as his own for safekeeping.
