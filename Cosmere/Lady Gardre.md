**Lady Gardre** is a member of the [[Elendel\|Elendel]] Senate on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. She served on the Governor's Council. [[Steris Harms\|Steris Harms]] suspects her to be the [[Set\|Set's]] spy.

## Appearance and Personality
Lady Gardre is a plump woman. She is a reasonable and rational politician, much less of a war-hawk than her other counterparts in the Council.

## History
After Steris informed Governor [[Varlance\|Varlance]] about a threat to the city, he established a Governorâ€™s Select Council to investigate the issue. This Council included Lady Gardre, [[Darlin Cett\|Lord Cett]] and [[Mari Hammondess\|Lady Hammondess]]. Throughout the Council's discussions, Steris suspected one of them to be a spy for the Set but could not decide who. When the Council unanimously declared that war with [[Bilming\|Bilming]] was inevitable, Steris surmised that Gardre was most likely to be the spy, her reasonable nature a front for Set's subterfuge.
With a bomb threat on [[Elendel\|Elendel]] imminent, Gardre excused herself from the council shortly before they decided to use the [[Bands of Mourning\|Bands of Mourning]]. She seemingly did not return. This and Steris' deductions hint that she was actually the spy, but it is not explicitly confirmed.
