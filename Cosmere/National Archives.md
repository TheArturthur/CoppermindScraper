>“*The Second Octant constables clustered and watched the crowd for pickpockets from the steps up into the National Archives.*”
\-Marasi's observations upon arriving for Governor Innate's speech[1]


The **National Archives** is a building in [[Elendel\|Elendel]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
The National Archives are located in the Second Octant, near the [[Field of Rebirth\|Field of Rebirth]] and across from the governor's mansion. Presumably, the archives store important historical documents.
Governor [[Replar Innate\|Replar Innate]] liked to address people from the governor's mansion. On at least one such occasion, in 342 [[Catacendre\|PC]], the constables kept an eye on the people from the steps leading up to the National Archives.
