>“* Man's life on Roshar is conflict.*”
\- from The Arguments, as quoted by Adolin[1]

## Content
[[Adolin Kholin\|Adolin Kholin]] quotes *The Arguments* to Dalinar, who refers to the work as "scripture". *The Arguments* may contain some historical or pseudohistorical information about human life on Roshar, as Adolin cites the book in reference to ongoing wars on Roshar since the time of the [[Tranquiline Halls\|Tranquiline Halls]]. Vorin culture has certain rules about sex and romance, and some of those rules may have originated in *The Arguments*; [[Navani\|Navani]] notes that the book does not forbid a marriage between a widow and her late husband's brother, although some devout Vorins maintain that such a relationship is inappropriate.

[[Shallan\|Shallan]] recalls painting passages from *The Arguments* while growing up in [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]], reciting them repeatedly and committing them to memory before burning the paper. Both Shallan and [[Ardent\|ardent]] [[Pai\|Pai]] cite a lack of connection to *The Arguments* when questioning the devotion of the [[Alethi\|Alethi]].
