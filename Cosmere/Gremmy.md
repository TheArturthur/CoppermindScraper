## Appearance and Personality
Gremmy, and his boss [[Sor\|Sor]] are described as the opposite ends of a tack. Gremmy is a squat-bodied, flat-headed man, who sports a haircut that says "What's the cheapest?" He can be a nervous individual on occasion, and has needed help with his bar tab from [[Brick's Tavern\|Brick's Tavern]], where he is often found with Sor, at least once.

## History
### Diggen's Point and Tress' Escape
Gremmy lived on Diggen's Point for an unknown period of time. Though, like most residents of Diggen's Point, he lived on The Rock for most of her life. Unable to leave, per the [[Verdant King\|Verdant King]] and **The Duke's** instructions.
Through [[Lem\|Lem]] cashing in on silent favors and invisible ledgers, Gremmy; along with Sor and [[Brick\|Brick]] arrived at [[Tress\|Tress']] house, and demanded to assist her in her escape of [[Diggen's Point\|Diggen's Point]]. Gremmy accomplishes this by rolling a sixth keg alongside five other barrels of ale, which contained [[Gret\|Gret]], Sor's daughter, and feathers, to muffle her breathing. The "inspector" was able to hear Gret inside the barrel and kicked it over, revealing her inside. This caused Gremmy to break down and start crying. However, Gremmy, Sor, Brick and Gret all knew this was a ruse, as the [[Inspector\|Inspector]], was in fact Tress in disguise.

### Tress' Return
Tress returns to Diggen's Point, as captain of the *Two Cups* but only for a short time. During her return, she takes special care to thank Gremmy, [[Brick\|Brick]], [[Gret\|Gret]], and [[Sor\|Sor]] for their assistance in helping her initially escape **The Rock.**
