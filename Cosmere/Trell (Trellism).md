>“*She looked down at the small spike in her hands, and heard a name from a year ago, spoken by Miles Hundredlives as he died. The name of a god from the old days... Who, or what, was Trell?*”

## Nature
Trell is the avatar of Autonomy. Harmony appears to use a vast, red haze around Scadrial to represent the intrusion of another Shard when meeting with [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]], and Wax described a sensation of "dread and destruction" choking him upon observing it. The appearance of red suggests that the entity is co-opting or corrupting the [[Investiture\|Investiture]] of another Shard.

## History

The name Trell has been used in many ways over the eons. Trell is not native to [[Yolen\|Yolen]].
The seeds for Trell's personality began to be placed during the Classical Scadrial time period when Autonomy prepped the planet for a potential later incursion. Following the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]] and the actions of [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] a group of individuals in the [[Scadrian System\|Scadrian System]] grew more interested in possessing powers that stem from off-world. These individuals began to research about the powers granted by 'ancient deities,' these groups eventually attracted the attention of [[Autonomy\|Autonomy]] who then began using their Trell personna again. The group would later go on to become the [[Set\|Set]].
Following this the religion of the Set began to morph into a newer form of Tregalism, renamed Trellism. Beyond Trellism, the first overt evidence of Trell's involvement came in the form of a mysterious spike used by [[Paalm\|Paalm]] to hide from Harmony's sight. According to Harmony, Trell had surrounded the planet of Scadrial and was laying siege to Harmony's defenses sometime around 340 [[Catacendre\|PC]].

## Associated Magic
A silvery metal with distinctive, dark red spots is associated with Trell. This metal has been utilized as a [[Hemalurgic\|Hemalurgic]] spike in several ways. First and foremost is the strange way that such a spike blinds Harmony to the recipient of the spike. Additionally, the spike may also be used to steal mysterious attributes previously unknown to the [[Kandra\|kandra]]. [[MeLaan\|MeLaan]] theorized that Paalm was able to utilize stolen [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]] and [[Feruchemy\|Feruchemy]] by means of these attributes. Lastly, the use of such a spike in [[Rian\|Rian]] appeared to cause, if nothing else, a level of psychological distress. It is possible that Miles was spiked with this metal as well, before he died.
There are red-eyed [[Faceless Immortal\|Faceless Immortals]] which appear to act as agents on behalf of Trell. It is unclear who or what these beings are and how similar they are to typical kandra.

## Religion
>“*You are fools! One day, the men of gold and red, bearers of the final metal, will come to you. And you will be ruled by them. Worship. Worship Trell and wait ...*”
\-Miles Dagouter's last words[17]


### Beliefs
Followers of Trellism appear to trace the religion's roots to [[Trelagism\|Trelagism]] as it is described in the [[Words of Founding\|Words of Founding]]. The extent to which these religions are related is unclear, as the two religions share no apparent similarities beyond the name of their god. Adherents of Trellism believe in a deity named Trell, whom they consider to be their creator in some capacity. At least some among them appear to believe in an apocalyptic prophecy which claims that "men of gold and red, bearers of the final metal" will arrive and rule over the people of [[Elendel\|Elendel]], and perhaps all of Scadrial.
Miles Dagouter encouraged people to actively worship Trell, though the details on how Trell is worshiped are unknown. Miles believed that Trell created him "to see wrongs righted" and that the religion's teachings proved he was "special" in some way. It is unclear to what extent Miles' beliefs concerning social justice are held in common among other members of the religion. It is likely that some kernel of these ideas is pervasive in Trellism, given some relations to the philosophies of Paalm and [[Edwarn Ladrian\|Edwarn Ladrian]].

### Followers
Despite the religion's mention in the Words of Founding, it is relatively unknown among the general population of northern Scadrial. [[Marasi Colms\|Marasi Colms]] had a difficult time researching the religion, with few people willing to speak openly about their knowledge. Several members of the Set, in both high and low positions, are followers of Trellism, and the organization itself may exist for the purpose of serving Trell. Presumed followers of Trellism have been seen both swearing by and giving thanks to Trell.
Red-eyed "[[Faceless Immortal\|Faceless Immortals]]" appear to work on behalf of Trell, and have been known to visit followers of Trell on occasion. Paalm also appears to be an agent of Trell, though neither Paalm or the red-eyed Faceless Immortals show any signs of being adherents of Trellism.

## Trivia
[[Brandon Sanderson\|Brandon's]] plans for Trell in future books were outlined during the writing of the first *Mistborn* trilogy. As the *Mistborn Era 2* books were not planned at the time, it comes as no surprise that Trell will have a much more prominent role in the *Mistborn Era 3* trilogy.
