## Geography
### Borders and Territories
Lossand is situated on the southern side of Dayside. Its borders form the shape of a wedge, stretching from Mount [[KraeDa\|KraeDa]] in the north to the southern [[Border Ocean\|Border Ocean]] in the south. Lossand is bordered by uninhabited [[Deep sand\|deep sand]] to the east, the [[Kerla\|Kerla]] of the nation of [[Kerzta\|Kerzta]] to the west and north. The [[Ry'Do Ali River\|Ry'DoAli]] River runs directly through the center of the nation. The [[Nor'Tallon River\|Nor'Tallon River]] flows from the eastern mountain range and joins the Ry'DoAli.

### Climate
Lossand is considered a desert, despite the water table provided by two rivers, due to a lack of dorim vines. Wells are unreliable, so settlement is confined to islands in the rivers and irrigable land on the river banks. Like all of Dayside, the temperature is hot-and steadily so since the sun is always shining. There is usually a steady breeze to help alleviate the heat. Near Mt. KraeDa, the sun is at the zenith; but at the southern coast, the sun is low enough in the sky that [[Darksider\|Darksiders]] can forgo their sunglasses.

### Notable Cities
[[Kezare\|Kezare]], the capital, is located in the northern half of Lossand, where the Ry'DoAli and Nor'Tallon Rivers meet.
[[Lraezare\|Lraezare]] lies on the southern coast at the mouth of the Ry'DoAli River.
## History
According to legend, Lossand was founded when two siblings-[[Kerzt\|Kerzt]] and [[Lossa\|Lossa]]-each claimed to have received visions from the [[Sand Lord\|Sand Lord]]; but the contents of those visions were disputed. Lossa claimed to have been blessed by the Sand Lord with [[Sand mastery\|sand mastery]] and, after assassination attempts by her brother, fled into the desert and eventually founded the nation of Lossand along the banks of the Ry'DoAli.
Relations between Lossand and Kerzta were often strained in the past, primarily due to religious rhetoric from the Kerztian clergy who claim that Lossand is a desert because it is cursed by the Sand Lord. The Kerztian priest [[DaiKeen\|DaiKeen]] is particularly opposed to Lossand's acceptance of sand mastery. This left the two nations frequently in a state of war with one another.
Tensions were eased two hundred years ago when a member of the Merchant DiaKeen was selected as the new king of Kerzta, but growing support behind Kerzta's [[A'kar\|high priest]] has cast doubt on the possibility of continued peace.

## Politics
Lossand is ruled by the [[Taishin\|Taishin]]â€”a council of the eight Taisha **Profession** heads, each representing a different sector of Lossand's economy. Each of the eight Professions has its own charter that establishes and regulates the collection of professions represented by its Taisha, including how the Taisha is selected to represent the profession. The Taisha of each profession is accorded the title "Lord" or "Lady," with the current leader of the council receiving the title "High." The current leader of the Taishin is High Judge [[Heelis\|Heelis]]. There is some overlap amongst most of the professions.
The [[Kelzi\|Kelzin]], wealthy land owners, form the upper class of Lossand and often try to influence the Taisha of whichever profession they claim. In some cases, such as the [[Helm\|Helm]], the Kelzin actually hold more political influence than their Taisha, whom they appoint as a political tool to control their rivals.
After most of the sand masters was massacred in the [[Kerla\|Kerla]], the other Taishin tried to disband the Diem. Each Taisha had their own reasons for taking this action against the sand profession, but in the end [[Kenton\|Kenton]] managed to save his Profession.
The eight professions are:

### The Diem of the Sand Masters
*For more information, see Diem*.
The **Diem** is the Profession of the [[Sand master\|sand masters]] of Lossand. Its Taisha is the Mastrell. The current Lord Mastrell is [[Kenton\|Kenton]]. The Diem is headquartered in the building of the same name. The Diem has no sub-professions.

### The Hall of Judges, Trackts, and Scribes
The **Hall**, is the Profession of the [[Trackt\|trackts]] and judges of Lossand. Its Taisha is the [[Lady Judge\|Judge]]. The current Lady Judge is Heelis, who is also the current head of the Taishin Council as High Judge. The Profession is headquartered in **The Hall of Judgement**. The Hall includes the sub-profession of scribes.

### The Guild of Merchants

The **Helm** is the Profession of the shipping industry of Lossand. Its Taisha is the [[Lord Admiral\|Admiral]]. The current Lord Admiral is [[Lokkall\|Lokkall]]. The Lord Admiral resides at **Helm's Rest**.

The true leadership of the Helm belongs to the **Shipowners' Circle**, currently headquartered in [[Lraezare\|Lraezare]].

## Culture
Lossand contains a mix of many cultures, including Kerztian and the [[Rim Kingdoms\|Rim Kingdoms]]. Many citizens of Lossand are ethnically Kerztian, and entire communities of Darksiders can be found. The most unique characteristic of Lossandin culture is the presence of the Diem of sand masters who, in the past, contributed to the nation's defense and infrastructure. While belief in the Sand Lord is not uncommon, there are no dominant organized religions. The Los'seen form of worship for the Sand Lord is often seen as more of a philosophy than a religion, though both faiths show reverence for the sun.
