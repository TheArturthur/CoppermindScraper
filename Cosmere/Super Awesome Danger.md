It is the story of two brothers who design a video game named *Super Awesome Danger* together, only for one of them to get trapped inside the game.

## Development
*Super Awesome Danger* was written in secret in 2021, during the period when Brandon was also developing four other secret novels that eventually became a massive [[/wiki/Dragonsteel Entertainment#Four Secret Novels .282022.29]]. No one outside of Brandon's immediate family was aware that he was writing these stories until after they were completed. Brandon did not include *Super Awesome Danger* in the Kickstarter because it is targeted at a different audience and he was not sure exactly how he planned to present it at the time. He has referred to it as "Secret Project Zero".
Brandon created the novel with his sons Oliver and Dallin and he describes it as a "gift to his children". In 2019, Oliver drew a picture of a robot frog named "Robog", including statistics somewhat similar to video or card games like . Brandon put the picture up in his house and looked at it daily, and it inspired him to begin a story about a kid and his toy named Robog that comes to life. When Brandon shared this with his sons, they were extremely excited about the fact that art could be translated into fiction and they made more concept art that Brandon worked into the story.
[[Dragonsteel Entertainment\|Dragonsteel Entertainment]] plans to publish the graphic novel in-house, with [[Ben McSweeney\|Ben McSweeney]] doing the layout and [[Hayley Lazo\|Hayley Lazo]] doing pencils and inks.
