**Sivi** is a highlady in [[Ruthar\|Ruthar's]] court on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. Near the end of the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]], she moved to the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]], leaving her husband at home to manage their lands; this was considered an unusual arrangement.
Her support of Ruthar meant that she also favored [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas]] and disliked [[House Kholin\|House Kholin]]; her contempt for [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] only increased after [[Adolin\|Adolin's]] duels brought shame to Ruthar and [[Aladar\|Aladar]]. Sivi was among three women who spoke to [[Highprince\|Highprince]] [[Loradar Vamah\|Loradar Vamah]] at a feast after people began to learn of [[Dalinar's visions\|Dalinar's visions]]. She was distributing leaflets that attempted to mock and discredit Dalinar. She scowled at Dalinar when he tried to engage Vamah in tactical discussion, and half-heartedly attempted to hide some of the leaflets she was holding.
