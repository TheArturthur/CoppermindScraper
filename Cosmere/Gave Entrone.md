## Appearance and Personality
Characterized by an ubiquitous smug smile, Gave sports a sharp chin and black hair, which he wears slicked back. He dresses for his job in formalwear and diamond cufflinks. He has a reputation for being dynamic and is overall well-regarded before his tenure as mayor.

## Attributes and Abilities
Gave is a [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgist]], granting him the power of a [[Iron\|Lurcher]], [[Steel\|Coinshot]], [[Pewter\|Pewterarm]], and [[Gold\|Bloodmaker]].

## History
Gave was born and raised in [[New Seran\|New Seran]]. He got into textiles and at one point did some business with [[House Ladrian\|House Ladrian]]. In 342 [[Catacendre\|PC]], he bought a few of the medallions recovered from the [[Southern Scadrian\|Southern Scadrian]] airship *[[Brunstell\|Brunstell]]*.
The same year, Gave attended [[Kelesina Shores\|Kelesina Shores']] [[Kelesina Shores' party\|party]]. [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]] wished to avoid him since he once dated Gave's cousin, [[Valette Entrone\|Valette Entrone]], but [[Steris\|Steris]] pointed out that Gave was one of their best options to talk to, as he was on a list of people possibly connected to the [[Bands of Mourning\|Bands of Mourning]] in [[ReLuur\|ReLuur's]] notebook. When Wax began asking him about archaeology, Gave insulted Wax in order to provoke a reaction and get an excuse to leave the conversation. After that didn't work, he instead insulted Steris, which caused Wax to snap in anger and instinctively reach for his gun.
He was elected mayor of Bilming in 346 [[Catacendre\|PC]] and became a figurehead for the Outer Cities. During his tenure, the city grew incredibly in terms of size and was remodeled. He moved to ban [[Noseball\|noseball]], but the ban was not enforced by the local constables.
Although Gave was an ally to the [[Set\|Set's]] presence in the city, he enacted a plan to take [[Telsin\|Telsin's]] place should she fail to take control of the Basin as proof to [[Autonomy\|Autonomy]] that she could rule Scadrial. He kidnapped people in [[Bilming\|Bilming]] who opposed his politics, including [[Kyndlip Ternavyl\|Kyndlip Ternavyl]] and [[Pielle Fromed\|Pielle Fromed]], and performed [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgic]] experiments on them in an attempt to find a way to create Metalborn in large numbers. When Autonomy's [[Men of gold and red\|army]] began to appear, he ordered an end to the project and retreated to the [[Community\|Community]] with those loyal to him. However, the [[Ghostbloods\|Ghostbloods]] and [[Marasi\|Marasi]] rescued the captives, and several likely gave evidence against him at a later date.
