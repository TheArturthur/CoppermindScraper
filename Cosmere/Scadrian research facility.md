The **Scadrian research facility** is a subterranean research outpost and spaceship on [[Canticle\|Canticle]] operated by the [[Scadrian\|Scadrian]] political faction the [[TimeTellers\|TimeTellers]] to conduct research into the Canticle system and its native [[Investiture\|Investiture]]. The vessel was erroneously thought by the citizens of [[Beacon\|Beacon]] to be the mythical [[Refuge of Stone\|Refuge of Stone]], an underground city from Canticlite legends.

## Design
The ship comprises three main levels with an elevator that that leads to a large metallic disc buried approximately two feet underground. The top deck is a large capsule shaped room with workstations and monitors on the walls. The top deck is the primary level for research as well as monitoring outside of the ship. The middle and bottom decks are respectively for assorted activities and personal quarters for the approximately two dozen crew. The floors of each deck are made of steel and the ceilings have modern lighting but are reminiscent of older incandescent bulbs. The facility is physically large enough to hold approximately 130 people but doing so would strain the life support systems. The exterior of the ship is presumably able to be pierced by a [[Shardblade\|shardblade]] as the researchers worry [[Zellion\|Zellion's]] threat to cut his way out will compromise the integrity of the hull.

## Capabilities
The ship is equipped with an [[Awakening\|Awakened]] [[Feruchemy\|Steelmind]] which gives status reports to the crew members. There is also at least one  on the top deck containing a supply of [[Dor\|Dor]] large enough to refill Zellion's Skip capacity, requiring around 20,000 BEUs.

### Navigation
The research vessel is presumed to be able to be able to launch into orbit, fly in atmosphere, bury itself underground, and survive and navigate in space. The ship also likely has a way to travel at near or faster than light speed in order to travel interstellar distances within a single lifetime.

### Defences
The facility is equipped with some form of energy weapon which is capable of firing on an an airship in flight through several feet of rock and soil with great accuracy. The hull is seemingly impervious to the devastating effects of Canticle's sunlight and the ensuing environmental turmoil and is able to maintain its position just beneath the surface even as the planet's crust is repeatedly liquefying and reforming. However, the hull is likely able to be cut with a shardblade.
The researchers onboard are equipped with gloves embedded with [[Southern Scadrian\|Southern Scadrian]] medallions with access to at least [[Allomancy\|Allomantic]] [[Steel\|Steel]], though their primary purpose is likely not intended for combat. Zellion was offered a position on the ship as a mercenary indicating that their interpersonal combat capabilities were lacking.

### Surveillance & Communication
The outpost can monitor the area surrounding its entrance and can hear words that are spoken aloud there. The ship can reply to people on the surface by extending some sort of pole approximately four feet long and projecting a voice through it. The ship has either a satellite system or drones that allow them to view the surface of the planet from overhead in real-time. The facility can also detect and communicate with other ships in orbit above the planet.

## Notable Research
One researcher is performing an experiment studying transferring Investiture from one [[Sunheart\|sunheart]] to another. She has managed to charge one of the sunhearts far beyond its regular capacity and is testing how much Investiture can be forced in. They have discovered how to recharge sunhearts by priming them with Investiture in the form of heat transferred from captive Canticlites and leaving them out in the sun. They have further determined that if they prime the sunheart with special Investiture, it will turn into a corrupted [[Sunheart\|cinderheart]] which can be used to create [[Charred\|Charred]]. They have also discovered that the planet's unique environment is caused by an interaction between the system's sun and the planet's core.

## History
The research vessel arrives on Canticle and submerges itself beneath the surface near the planet's equator. The [[Cinder King\|Cinder King]] discovers the facility and makes contact with the crew inside, establishing a trade deal of sunhearts in exchange for technology and information. The crew give the Cinder King an [[Haridan's authorization key\|authorization key]] to access the ship in the future. The ship is discovered by Zellion and the Beaconites. Zellion asks for asylum for himself and the citizens of Beacon citing the Refugee and Lost Expatriate Bill of [[Silverlight Codes of Interplanetary Conduct\|Silverlight Codes of Interplanetary Conduct]]. The Scadrian scientists agree to hear them out and fire a warning shot across the Cinder King's bow with their energy weapon to keep him at bay. They then allow Zellion accompanied by [[Confidence\|Confidence]], [[Contemplation\|Contemplation]], and [[Rebeke Salvage\|Rebeke Salvage]] to enter the ship. The Scadrians allow Zellion to stay on board acting as a mercenary but refuse entry to the Beaconites. After learning of Zellion's identity, the researchers attack him and Zellion escapes the ship by threatening to cut a hole in the hull with his shardblade.
