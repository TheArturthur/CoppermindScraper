In the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]], **Sliver** is a term generally used by scholars for someone who previously held at least a significant portion of a [[Shard\|Shard's]] [[Investiture\|Investiture]] and has since released it, though the term can have a variety of meanings and its exact usage is something of a moving target.

## Nature
The effects of being a Sliver can vary, based on factors like the [[Intention\|Intent]] associated with the Investiture they held and how long they held that power for. In general, holding the amount of Investiture required to become a Sliver greatly expands a person's mind, allowing them to better use the vast power they hold. When a person later releases that power and becomes a Sliver, their mind and soul do not simply return to a baseline, as holding that much Investiture has a lasting effect. Some changes, such as how the Intent of a Shard will warp the mindset of its Vessel, will fade over time, while other changes are permanent.
Despite having released the power they once held, a Sliver is still noticeably more Invested than the average person, which likely contributes to some of their other traits. Most notably, Slivers can resist the pull of the [[Beyond\|Beyond]] indefinitely and choose to instead remain in the cosmere as a [[Cognitive Shadow\|Cognitive Shadow]] if they wish. Beyond that, they are also more capable of influencing the Physical Realm from the Cognitive and are more resistant to the influence and control of a Shard.

## Known and Potential Slivers

For a list of all known Slivers, see Category:Slivers.
[[Rashek\|Rashek]] and [[Vin\|Vin]] are both Slivers as a result of holding [[Preservation\|Preservation's]] power at the [[Well of Ascension\|Well of Ascension]]. [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] is also a Sliver of Preservation, as he served as the Shard's Vessel between the death of [[Leras\|Leras]] and the Ascension of Vin.
When [[Tanavast\|Tanavast]], the Vessel of [[Honor\|Honor]], died, he left a Cognitive Shadow that merged with the [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]]. As a result, the Stormfather is also a Sliver, though he may not fit into standard categories as well as most entities do. Because of the Stormfather's [[Nahel bond\|Nahel bond]] to [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]], Dalinar may have become something like a Sliver; [[Odium\|Odium]] refers to Dalinar as having Ascended after he opened [[Honor's Perpendicularity\|Honor's Perpendicularity]] at the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]], but Dalinar's exact status after this event remains unclear.
[[Telsin Ladrian\|Telsin Ladrian]], who was on the path to becoming an [[Avatar\|avatar]] of [[Autonomy\|Autonomy]], claims that she would be a Sliver of Autonomy once she is fully Invested.
While most scholars would not consider [[Nightblood\|Nightblood]] or [[Hoid\|Hoid]] to be Slivers, some might argue that they are because of the amount of Investiture they have accumulated.
