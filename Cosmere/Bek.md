**Queen Bek the Fifteenth** is a queen on [[Lumar\|Lumar]] and a known [[Spore eater\|spore eater]]. She is reportedly the only person in recorded history on Lumar to be cured from her condition, and [[Xisis\|Xisis]] was allegedly involved.
As Xisis claims he can only temporarily subdue the gestation, and not completely remove it, Bek may not have been entirely cured as histories claim. However, this could have been a lie to prevent [[Crow\|Crow]] from trying to escape.
