>“*If a king is destroying his country, is it not the right—the duty—of the people to see him removed?*”
\-Rill, on Elhokar[1]


**Rill** is a mercenary on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] and a member of the [[Diagram (group)\|Diagram]]. He is a conspirator in the plot to assassinate [[Elhokar Kholin\|Elhokar Kholin]], along with [[Graves\|Graves]] and [[Danlan\|Danlan]].
He has dark, sunken eyes and short hair. He wears heavy leathers and carries an axe. When Moash introduced [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] to Rill, Kaladin immediately identified him as a mercenary.
[[Moash\|Moash]] met Rill before he joined the army, while both of them were working for various caravans. Rill sought out Moash after [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]] was liberated and may have been the person to recruit him into the arm of the Diagram led by Graves. Rill agreed with Graves that Elhokar was an incompetent king who was destroying Alethkar. He believed that regicide would save the country, and he saw [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] as a better candidate to be king. He was present at the [[Ornery Chull\|Ornery Chull]] when Moash tried to convince Kaladin to join their cause. It is unclear what specific role Rill played in the assassination attempt.
