**Faultline** is a powerful [[Epic\|Epic]] who initially works for [[Steelheart (Epic)\|Steelheart]]. She is a thin woman who wears her hair in a bun.

## Attributes and Ability
Faultline has two second-tier abilities--moving softer earth and turning earth and stone into sand--which combine into a first-tier power. She is powerful, but fragile, as she has no prime invincibility.
It is also known that Faultline can appear to make earthquakes, by softening the earth and pulling back on it, though it is never shown.

## History
Faultline was seen using her powers when she sent the [[First Union Bank (Newcago)\|First Union Bank]] deep underground by turning the earth into sand, and letting it sink. She also created a cushion of earth around the bank as it sank, ultimately protecting it.
Faultline later challenged Steelheart, attempting to take over [[Newcago\|Newcago]]. Steelheart dealt with her personally, and killed her.
