>“*[Curiosities] are those books I wrote before I got published, the ones that are still good, but we've never done anything with.*”
\-Brandon Sanderson[1]


**Sanderson Curiosities** are books written by [[Brandon Sanderson\|Brandon Sanderson]] that initially went unpublished for various reasons but were later released by [[Dragonsteel Entertainment\|Dragonsteel Entertainment]] as bonus material. They may be earlier versions of novels that were reworked and published in a different form or books that were abandoned due to other priorities; they are therefore considered non-canonical. They help illustrate Brandon's evolution as a writer, and can provide insight into how a book changed over time or how elements of one book were repurposed for another. The books have a very minimal editing pass and are presented in something close to their "raw" form dating back to whenever Brandon ceased actively working on them.

## Released
*[[The Way of Kings Prime\|The Way of Kings Prime]]* (2020)
This early version of the novel was included with the 2020 Kickstarter campaign for the leatherbound edition of *[[The Way of Kings\|The Way of Kings]]*. A physical version was offered as a bonus item for supporting higher tiers of the Kickstarter, while the e-book and later the audiobook versions were released for free on Brandon's websites. The book was well-received, and inspired the team to do more Curiosities in the future.

*[[Long Chills %26 Case Dough\|Long Chills & Case Dough]]* (2023)
A novelette that was a surprise inclusion as a hardcover in the final box of the 2023 "[[Year of Sanderson\|Year of Sanderson]]" Kickstarter campaign. The book was also made available for purchase on Dragonsteel's website, and the e-book can be downloaded for free.

[[Isaac Stewart\|Isaac Stewart]] stated that physical editions of future Curiosities were intended to maintain a similar style to that of *The Way of Kings Prime*. However, *Long Chills & Case Dough*, being a short story, is much smaller in all dimensions than *The Way of Kings Prime*, and has a different cover material.

## Potential Releases
Brandon has a list of early works that he would consider releasing as Curiosities, but he considers several factors before deciding to publish them. One is the overall quality of the book; he understands that people are reading the Curiosities with fan or academic interest, but he would still hesitate to release something that he thinks is badly written. He also has to watch out for story or character elements that could still be spoilers for upcoming books.
Brandon has mentioned the following works as potential Curiosities:


[[White Sand (prose)\|White Sand (prose)]]
*[[Aether of Night\|Aether of Night]]*
*White Sand* may be reworked and published as a canon novel. A similar treatment has been mentioned for *Aether of Night* in the past. If those novels are reworked, the earlier versions would still be planned for future release as Curiosities.


*[[Mistborn Prime\|Mistborn Prime]]*
*[[Final Empire Prime\|Final Empire Prime]]*

*[[Star's End\|Star's End]]*
*[[Knight Life\|Knight Life]]*
*[[The Sixth Incarnation of Pandora\|The Sixth Incarnation of Pandora]]*

*[[Lord Mastrell\|Lord Mastrell]]*, also known as *Lord Mastrell Prime*

*[[Mythwalker\|Mythwalker]]* (was abandoned midway through the writing process and heavily cannibalized for other books)
