## Appearance and Personality
A crewmember (Doug) from the *Crow's Song* describes Weev as a nice guy who was terrible at bluffing and playing cards. He was the only one to argue against piracy, and didn't deserve getting murdered. [[Hoid\|Hoid]] acknowledges that Weev was a cunning fellow up until he argued with Crow.

## Attributes and Abilities
>“*I'd have called him crazier than a nitroglycerin smoothie.*”
\-Hoid describing Weev[3]

Weev was a sprouter and often used and experimented with [[Aether spores\|aether spores]]. All sprouters are viewed as crazy, but Weev was crazier than the rest.
Before he died, Weev likely did the majority of the cooking for the crew of the *Crow's Song*.

## History
Weev had a room on the *Crow's Song* with a bed, mirror, and running water, but no silver to allow for experiments with spores. Though it was larger than other officer's rooms, it remained unclaimed until [[Tress\|Tress]] took his job as a sprouter. While he did use the running water for spore experiments, it was also an excuse to take baths at his leisure.
He collected several different types of spores, including zephyr, rose, verdant, sunlight, and midnight spores. He acquired the midnight spores from Hoid. In his profession, Weev was considered a purist and preferred classical tools over modern ones. His tools for patching holes in the ship included a small iron plate and a steel trowel. Over the course of his experiments, he compiled a considerable collection of notes detailing his results and knowledge, but they were not very organized. He was a mental hoarder, and had a tendency to write down random thoughts and half-finished ideas. Crow wanted him to figure out how to make cannonballs himself to save money, but he never succeeded.
During Crow's quest to heal herself, she had secret meetings with Weev to help her locate [[Xisisrefliel\|Xisisrefliel]]. According to Crow's notes, these ended when he turned to blackmail and Crow threw him off the ship.
