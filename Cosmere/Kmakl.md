## Appearance and Personality
>“*By Kelek, storms, and Passions alike, what is that?*”
\-Kmakl, seeing the red mist of Nergaoul[2]


He is aging, and has drooping mustaches that match his long Thaylen eyebrows. He wears a vest and a cap. He is described as "a navy man", and holds the rank of Admiral in the Thaylen navy. He is not a [[Shardbearer\|Shardbearer]] and does not carry a sword; Dalinar notes that this would be unusual for someone of Kmakl's rank in [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]].
He is among the most skilled naval tacticians in the [[Coalition of monarchs\|coalition of monarchs]]. He is intelligent, optimistic, and courageous, and seems to be physically fit given his age. He honors tradition and established policies, but he is willing to embrace innovation. He is an amiable man, although he jokingly refers to himself as a "grouchy old sailor".
Like many Thaylens, Kmakl seems to have an affinity for both [[Vorin\|Vorinism]] and the [[Passions\|Passions]].

## History
Kmakl was present when [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] arrived in [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]] to assess the damage from the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]]. He was attended by several scribes and instructed them to write down important bits of Fen's conversation with Dalinar for the official record.
He and Fen attended a meeting of Dalinar's coalition of monarchs in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], and Kmakl seemed satisfied with [[Navani\|Navani's]] suggestion that the Thaylens oversee trade and supplies.

### Battle of Thaylen Field, 1174
As the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]] unfolded, Kmakl, Fen, and Navani Kholin surveyed the battlefield from the city walls. Kmakl believed that the coalition might successfully defend the city until a [[Thunderclast\|thunderclast]] appeared nearby, shaking the ground and severely damaging the wall. Kmakl suffered a cut to his scalp, but he and Fen were able to escape down a staircase to a guard chamber. However, they were seized by soldiers from [[Sadeas princedom\|House Sadeas]] under the influence of the [[Thrill\|Thrill]]. They were bound and gagged and the soldiers moved to kill Kmakl, since [[Amaram\|Amaram]] would only care about the queens. Kmakl tried to face his death with dignity, but the soldiers continued to manhandle him until Navani was able to incapacitate them with her [[Painrial\|painrial]].
Kmakl and Fen subsequently witnessed [[Nergaoul\|Nergaoul's]] appearance on the battlefield, Dalinar summoning [[Honor's Perpendicularity\|Honor's Perpendicularity]], Jasnah [[Soulcast\|Soulcasting]] a new section of one of the city's walls, and their son [[Kdralk\|Kdralk]] attempting to recover a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]]. Kmakl thought the new wall would hold off [[Odium\|Odium's]] forces until he saw the sheer number of [[Singer\|singers]] that were prepared to attack, driven by the Thrill.

### True Desolation
Although [[Odium\|Odium's]] forces stole a number of ships from Thaylenah, the country retained a fleet large enough to win a decisive naval victory in late 1174, giving them control of most of Roshar's southern seas.

>“*I can't decide if I’m glad to be old enough to wish my world a fond farewell, or if I envy the young lads who get to explore this new world.*”
\-Kmakl reflecting on fabrial technology potentially making ships obsolete[3]

In early 1175, Navani invited Kmakl aboard the *Fourth Bridge* for its mission to evacuate [[Hearthstone\|Hearthstone]]. He was fascinated by the airship and considered it to be fast given its size. However, he felt sadness regarding its existence because he believed that it was a sign that naval forces would become obsolete. By this time, Kmakl was part of Dalinar's military leadership of the coalition of monarchs, and he believed a large fleet of the airships would be an incredibly powerful weapon for both direct assaults and troop support if they could be protected from enemy [[Surgebinder\|Surgebinders]].
Kmakl joined the coalition's forces in [[Emul\|Emul]] during the planning for their military offensive. Two days after King [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]] betrayed the coalition, Kmakl informed them during a military meeting that the Thaylen navy had locked the Veden ships into their ports. He believed the blockade would be effective unless the enemy committed a large number of [[Fused\|Fused]] or [[Skybreakers\|Skybreakers]] to try and break through.

## Relationships
### Queen Fen
Fen remarks that Kmakl was partcularly smitten during their first days courting. He is often by the queen's side and sometimes acts as an informal advisor, but he does not interfere with her duties as monarch, ensuring that she has final say on all decisions.

### Dalinar and Navani Kholin
Both Navani and Dalinar are fond of Kmakl. Dalinar sometimes gets annoyed by the fact that bureaucracy slows Kmakl and Fen's decision making.
