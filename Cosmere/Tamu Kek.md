**Tamu Keks** are a type of bone that can be used for inter-[[Realmatic Theory\|Realm]] and interplanetary communication, similar to a [[Seon\|seon]]. Most notably they are used to interact with [[Dragon (cosmere)\|dragons]] for purposes of prayer. They have some similarities to [[Singer\|singer]] [[Gemheart\|gemhearts]].

## Trivia
When writing *[[Rhythm of War\|Rhythm of War]]*, Brandon debated whether to have the communication box that [[Mraize\|Mraize]] gave to [[Shallan\|Shallan]] contain a seon or a Tamu Kek, but eventually settled on making it a seon because they have personalities whereas Tamu Keks are just bones.
Tamu Keks originated in the book *[[Dragonsteel Prime\|Dragonsteel Prime]]*.
