## Trivia
An excerpt from the first chapter of this graphic novel can be found in [[Arcanum Unbounded\|Arcanum Unbounded]] alongside the original [[White Sand (prose)\|prose]] source material for that section.
In Chapter 2 when Kenton wakes up after his fight with the [[Sandling\|sandling]] there is a boombox in the tent behind him. [[Brandon\|Brandon]] has confirmed that this is not canonical as the residents of Taldain had not yet reached that level of technology at the time of the story. [[Isaac Stewart\|Isaac Stewart]] said that the artist who colored the graphic novel misunderstood the line art and that there was not enough time to change it before the book went to print. He also said that when they put out a second edition of the book this and the other inconsistencies will be fixed. These revisions were accomplished for the omnibus edition.
