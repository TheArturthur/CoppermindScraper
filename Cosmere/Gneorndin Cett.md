**Gneorndin Cett** is the only son of [[Ashweather Cett\|Ashweather Cett]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].

## Personality
Gneorndin has a strong protective instinct for his family. He dislikes [[Breeze\|Breeze]] for being in a relationship with his sister, [[Allrianne\|Allrianne]], who is much younger than Breeze. When [[Vin\|Vin]] threatens his father's life, Gneorndin attempts to protect his father, despite his lack of powers and fear of Vin's abilities.

## History
After the [[Collapse\|Collapse]], Gneorndin invited King [[Elend Venture\|Elend Venture]] to meet with his father, King [[Ashweather Cett\|Ashweather Cett]] in a week to discuss [[Allrianne\|Allrianne]]. He accused Elend of kidnapping her, even though he knew it was not true. Gneorndin also seemed to know at that point that Breeze was in a relationship with Allrianne, due to the fact that he glared at Breeze and did not seem to like him very much.
When [[Vin\|Vin]] launched her attack with [[Zane Venture\|Zane Venture]] on [[Keep Hasting\|Keep Hasting]], Gneorndin was there. Although he had no [[Allomantic\|Allomantic]] powers, Gneorndin tried to protect his father from Vin's wrath. On Cett's request, Vin simply knocked him aside rather than seriously injuring or killing him.
After Cett joined his forces with Elend's, Gneorndin was at the meeting of the crew when Elend explained how the encroaching [[Mist\|mists]] of the [[Deepness\|Deepness]] would soon make growing conventional crops impossible.
As Gneorndin is the only known male member of [[House Cett\|House Cett]] (aside from [[Ashweather\|Ashweather]]), it seems likely that through his lineage the house continued to exist past the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]] and into [[Mistborn Era 2\|Mistborn Era 2]] and modern Scadrial.
