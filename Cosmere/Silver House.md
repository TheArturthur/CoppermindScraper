The **Silver House** is a mansion in [[Bilming\|Bilming]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. It is the residence of the sitting lord mayor.

## Design
The building is far from the tallest in Bilming, but its design and silvery-white paint give it a majestic quality. It has a "springy" grass lawn.

## History
In 348 [[Catacendre\|PC]], the Silver House was home to mayor [[Gave Entrone\|Gave Entrone]], although he owned another mansion at the edge of town.
During [[Wax\|Wax]] and [[Wayne\|Wayne's]] investigation of [[Telsin\|Telsin]] and the [[Set\|Set]], they became suspicious of Gave. They traveled to Bilming and broke into his office in the Silver House, where Wax discovered a calendar with various references to a "lab", a safe that only a [[Mistborn\|Mistborn]] or [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgist]] could open, and a trapdoor. The trapdoor led to a small bunker with access to a storm drain, such that someone could leave the building undetected. Wayne, who was tasked with creating a distraction, set a fire that quickly raged out of control until the building was fully ablaze.
The Set had not anticipated Wax breaking into the building, and the information he found there helped him piece together Gave's true intentions.
