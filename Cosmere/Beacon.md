## Geography and Resources
It is unknown in what corridor Beacon flew before rebelling against the [[Cinder King\|Cinder King]]. After rebelling they flew at the South Pole and near the equator.
Beacon needs [[Sunheart\|sunhearts]] to fly, unlike on [[Union\|Union]] however, there are always volunteers from among the sick and the elderly.

## Layout
Like all cities on Canticle, Beacon is made of many smaller ships that can link together to be steered as one. The layout of the city changes as ships separate and recombine in different arrangements, but generally the farther out from the center one goes, the smaller the ships get. The largest ship containing the [[Chorus\|Chorus]] is always at the center.

## Politics
Beacon is ruled by the Greater Good, three old women by the names of [[Confidence\|Confidence]], [[Compassion\|Compassion]] and [[Contemplation\|Contemplation]]. When one of these women dies, a new member is appointed.
The Greater Good also elect a Lodestar, the Chief Navigator.

## History
Beacon was a Union between a smaller community and a number of people from [[Union\|Union]]. For most of its history it flew in an unknown corridor. At an unknown time the [[Cinder King\|Cinder King]] conquered it and assigned a few people along with some [[Charred\|Charred]] to rule it.
After some time the people decided to rebel against the Cinder King.
