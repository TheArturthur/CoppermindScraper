## Appearance and Personality

## History
Adawathwyn became the Vice Governor of Elendel under Governor [[Varlance\|Varlance]]. She was involved in almost every policy decision he took.
After [[Steris\|Steris]] informed her of a bomb threat to Elendel, she established a Council to investigate it but also manoeuvred to exclude House Ladrian. The Council consisted only of three senators, [[Darlin Cett\|Lord Cett]], [[Mari Hammondess\|Lady Hammondess]] and [[Lady Gardre\|Lady Gardre]].
When [[Reddi\|Constable-General Reddi]] invites Steris to the meeting anyway as a subject matter expert, Adawathwyn was not happy.. When the Council proposed a war that Reddi was opposed to, she planned to use a  to force them. Her actions seem to benefit the [[Set\|Set]] but Steris believed she was secretly encouraged but not directly influenced by them.
Adawathwyn and the Council finally believe Steris after [[TenSoon\|TenSoon]] revealed himself, disguised as a police officer. As a [[/wiki/Zinc#Feruchemical Use]] Ferring, she planned to use the [[Bands of Mourning\|Bands of Mourning]] to safely dispose of the bombs. However, Tensoon revealed that the bands are drained, so Adawathwyn could not try the plan. Considering the destruction of the city imminent, Adawathwyn and the other Senators in the Council fled the city, leaving behind Steris and Varlance to evacuate everyone else.
After the crisis was over, Adawathwyn was fired by Governor Varlance.
