>“*We like huts. Sure, we could build skyscrapers or castles. But why? To cut ourselves off from the sky with walls of stone and steel?*”
\-King Talakimallo explaining the simplistic housing to Alcatraz[1]


**Tuki Tuki** is the capital city of [[Mokia\|Mokia]] in the . It is called the City of Flowers, as everything in the city is covered with flowers. The roads are lined with flower beds, as well as trees, whose branches have more flowers hanging over the roads. The housing is mostly comprised of simplistic reed huts, many of which are generously decorated with flowers. The flowers are all non-allergenic, and were asked to be so by the city’s floralinguists, who can talk to the flowers. Its primary defensive feature is an enormous protective dome made out of . It protects the city from enemy attacks, such as launched projectiles.

## Geography
It is located on the southern coast of Biggest Island, in northern Mokia.

## History
>“*Mokia stands here. We’ve been beaten down by Librarian forces for decades now; if Tuki Tuki falls, it will spend the end for my people. We will become just another Librarian province, slowly assimilated into the hush lands, our people brainwashed until we forget our past.*”
\-King Talakimallo to Bastille


After the Librarian plot involving a peace treaty was foiled, they began an all out siege on Tuki Tuki, encircling the city and hammering away at its defensive dome. [[Talakimallo\|Talakimallo]] had supposedly been sent somewhere safe, but rather than leave his people, he sent his daughter using  to impersonate him and escape. The Shielder's Glass surrounding the city was nearly shattered, and Talakimallo was about to surrender, but Alcatraz successfully convinced him to keep fighting. They used  to convince the Nalhallans to send support, and [[Leavenworth Smedry\|Leavenworth Smedry]] was sent with a fleet. But then, the Librarians emerged from a tunnel and attacked the city, putting Talakimallo in a coma. Since the king was no longer available, Alcatraz was the highest ranking person present, and was named leading monarch. Through a clever manipulation of Leavenworth's Talent, he was able to speed up the reinforcements, but it wasn't enough. The Shielder's Glass was broken, and Bastille was injured. His emotions building up inside him allowed him to use the breaking  to break the Librarian weapons, causing the Librarians to give up and leave. Though the city was safe, it was badly demolished during the fighting, and many Mokians ended up in comas. Many of the huts were completely demolished, and many lawns were peppered with debris.
