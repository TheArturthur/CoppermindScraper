**Vyre's knife** is a bright golden [[Raysium\|raysium]] blade with a sapphire set into the pommel, used to kill the [[Herald\|Herald]] [[Jezrien\|Jezrien]] and trap his soul so that he couldn't be reborn.

## History
 by  Soph Peralta  [[Hnanan\|Hnanan]] giving the knife to [[Moash\|Moash]]/Vyre
The circumstances of the knife's creation are unknown. It was given by the [[Fused\|Fused]] [[Hnanan\|Hnanan]] to [[Moash\|Moash]] (later known as Vyre). Hnanan told Moash that [[Odium\|Odium]] had tasked him with killing a god; Moash noted that the Fused appeared to be afraid of using the knife on Jezrien themselves. Moash then used the knife to kill Jezrien. After the murder, Moash removed the knife from Jezrien's body, but the subsequent fate of the knife is unknown.

## Mechanics
The knife can kill a Herald by trapping the soul, preventing the Herald from returning to [[Braize\|Braize]] as a "conventional" Herald death would. Jezrien, while initially in a drunken stupor, quickly realizes that something about this death is different and claims to feel the knife drawing something from him into itself. [[Shalash\|Shalash]] and [[Kalak\|Kalak]] likewise instantly distinguishes it from previous deaths, as they could no longer sense Jezrien's soul.
The knife "traps" the soul so it can't be reborn. It functions by absorbing all of the Investiture that makes up the Cognitive Shadow of a Herald, running it down the length of the blade and into the gemstone set into the pommel. This process operates under similar principles to the [[Scadrian\|Scadrian]] manifestation of [[Investiture\|Investiture]] known as [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgy]], where practitioners are able to steal part of an individual's [[Spiritweb\|spiritweb]] using metal spikes. It would cause debate among [[Cosmere\|cosmere]] philosophers whether the knife's magical properties are in fact Hemalurgy or rather a related, but distinct, phenomenon.
Following Jezrien's death, the sapphire set into the knife takes on a "subdued glow". The sapphire in the knife's hilt is specifically for Jezrien. Whether the use of that specific [[Polestone\|polestone]] is mechanically relevant or only symbolic is unknown.
The knife shares characteristics with [[Nightblood\|Nightblood]], as they both bleed black smoke and leave blackened wounds.
