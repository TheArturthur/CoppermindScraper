**Fedik** was a [[Scadrian\|Scadrian]] who lived during the [[Classical Scadrial\|classical era]].
Fedik is known only from [[Alendi's journal\|Alendi's journal]]. He was a member of the party that traveled with [[Alendi\|Alendi]] to the [[Well of Ascension\|Well of Ascension]] shortly before the [[Ascension of the Lord Ruler\|Ascension of the Lord Ruler]]. He was suspicious of the party's [[Terris\|Terrismen]] guides, fearing that they would abandon the group in the mountains. This implies that Fedik was from [[Khlennium\|Khlennium]] or one of the other nations that supported Alendi's quest.
During the journey, Fedik discovered [[Ruin's Perpendicularity\|Ruin's Perpendicularity]]. He was curious about it, but Alendi did not allow him to take a sample of the waters. Fedik was subsequently stabbed in the chest by a mist spirit wielding an "invisible knife" that had been following the group. Alendi wondered if the spirit had been angered by Fedik's interest in the Perpendicularity. Fedik survived the stabbing and continued on the expedition, but he was traumatized by both his wound and the sight of the spirit; Alendi feared that he would accidentally wander off of a cliffside.
Alendi was the only other person that saw the mist spirit stab Fedik. [[Rashek\|Rashek]] spread rumors that Alendi was the actual perpetrator, causing Alendi to question his own sanity.

## Trivia
The identity of the mist spirit that stabbed Fedik is unclear. Brandon has [[RAFO\|RAFO'd]] most questions about it, such as whether it was [[Preservation\|Preservation]] or [[Ruin\|Ruin]] and the possibility of the knife being a [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgic spike]]. It is not the same mist spirit later seen by [[Vin\|Vin]] and [[Elend\|Elend]].
