***The Aztlanian*** is a planned sequel to *[[The Rithmatist\|The Rithmatist]]*.

## Development
Brandon initially tried to start work on *The Aztlanian* in May 2014. He eventually decided that since he was using real world cultures, namely various cultures from Meso- and South America, he needed to do significantly more research than he had originally planned. This resulted in the entire month being taken up with research instead of writing. At the end of the month, however, he felt the research he had done was not enough so he shelved the book until he could do more.
[[Joel\|Joel]] and [[Melody\|Melody]] were planned to return for the sequel, along with a third protagonist. It was planned to involve the [[Aztek Federation\|Aztek Federation]] and touch on the theme of colonialism, and would have included the lost .
As of December 2016 *The Aztlanian* was Brandon's most requested book. It was potentially going to have been written during 2017, but it did not happen. Brandon still knew that he needed to take a thoughtful approach to fictionalizing the mythology and history of the real-life cultures involved. He largely discarded his original outline and wrote a new one that he was happier with, but could not find space in his schedule to devote adequate time to finishing the book.
In 2019, Brandon said that the earliest he would start writing *The Aztlanian* was after *[[Bastille Versus the Evil Librarians\|Bastille Versus the Evil Librarians]]* was finished. As of 2021, Brandon was seeking a co-author who was well-versed in Aztec lore to help complete the book, but he noted that it would not take priority over his mainline series.
In 2020, Brandon said that he might work on the Aztlanian if he ran out of steam working on Mistborn Era 3. In 2021, the only other things worth noting is that he had mentioned that he was researching to find authors knowledgeable in Aztec mythology. He also said that he realizes that many people want a follow-up to *The Rithmatist*. In 2022, Brandon stated that the Alcatraz series was done, and now the Rithmatist series was the only one left to work on out of his secondary projects. In the [[State of the Sanderson\|State of the Sanderson]] 2022, he joked that "I almost don’t want to get back to that one now, if only for the memes…" while also confirming that he would not be working on any other sequels until after the completion of *[[Wind and Truth\|Wind and Truth]]*.
