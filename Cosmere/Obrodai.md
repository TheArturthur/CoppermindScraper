>“*You should not return to Obrodai. We have claimed that world, and a new avatar of our being is beginning to manifest there.*”
\-Patji to Hoid[1]


**Obrodai** is a planet in the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]].
The [[Shard\|Shard]] [[Autonomy\|Autonomy]] has claimed Obrodai and is beginning to manifest an "avatar of [their] being," an unknown female entity, on the planet. It is unknown whether there are any other Shards active on Obrodai.
In a letter to [[Hoid\|Hoid]], [[Patji (being)\|Patji]], an avatar of Autonomy warned him not to return to Obrodai and that, as a precaution to discourage his return, the avatar there has been instilled with a great dislike of him.
Due to Hoid being able to go to the planet, it likely has some form of [[Perpendicularity\|Perpendicularity]].

## Trivia
When asked if Obrodai was a name one of the planets of the [[Drominad System\|Drominad System]] used for themselves, Brandon responded with a RAFO. He has also avoided saying if it is a planet that we have already seen.
