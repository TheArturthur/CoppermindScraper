**Charisa of Utaries** is a celebrated fighter pilot, squadron leader, and ally of [[Varion Crestmar\|Varion Crestmar]]. She was one of the first rebel commanders to join Varion. Many biographies and histories spoke of her, but neglected to mention the fact that Varion looked upon her with a great deal of fondness.
During a final battle between imperial forces and Varion near the planet Falna, [[Dennison Crestmar\|Dennison Crestmar]] ordered an attack on Charisa's squadron, saying that nothing was important as destroying those fighters, which would be a big blow to Varion personally. The fighters were destroyed, and Charisa as well.
