\-Flik, on Charlie's fate[1]


**Thanasmia** is a place or entity related to [[Lumar\|Lumar]] in the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]].
[[Flik\|Flik]] refers to sailing under "Thanasmia's own moon" when telling [[Tress\|Tress]] that [[Charlie\|Charlie]] was forced to travel the [[Midnight Sea\|Midnight Sea]]. He is the only person to use the term, and does not elaborate. It is therefore unclear who or what Thanasmia is.

The context of Flik's statement implies that Thanasmia could be a name for the [[/wiki/Aether#Lumar aethers]] that presumably lives on the moon above the Midnight Sea, but his statement is not definitive. He could theoretically be referring to the Midnight Sea itself, several types of entities in the cosmere (such as an [[Aetherbound\|Aetherbound]] or a [[/wiki/Aether#Primal Aethers]]), or a figure from local legend or religion on Lumar. The prominence of both aether spores and Lumar's twelve moons in their culture means that they are often referred to by multiple names and nicknames, further obscuring the origin of the term.
