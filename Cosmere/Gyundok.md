**Gyundok** is the lead [[Torish\|Torish]] scholar from the [[Institute of Mechanical Solutions\|Institute of Mechanical Solutions]] who is involved in the creation of the [[Father machine\|father machine]] and who is later sent by the machine to prevent [[Yumi\|Yumi]] from escaping her prison.

## Appearance and Personality
Gyundok has a pinched face, and a pointing head. Like other Torish scholars, he has a bearded chin and mustache, and he wears his hair in a bowl cut. He wears white clothing with a black, winged .
Gyundok is a commanding leader who takes charge in most situations and prefers to make his subordinates take risks that he's not comfortable taking himself. He also shows himself to be a charismatic orator when his team first arrives in Gongsha.

## History
Prior to his death, Gyundok worked with other scholars to develop and activate the father machine. His soul was kept in reserve by the machine upon its activation, for the purpose of its self-defense, though he was still turned into a [[Nightmare\|nightmare]]. When Yumi's mind became resistant to the machine's tampering, Gyundok was one of the four scholars sent to [[Gongsha Town\|Gongsha Town]] to investigate.
When they arrived on Gongsha, Gyundok announced they had heard of the residents' troubles and explained that they had come with a machine to summon the [[Hijo\|hijo]]. Their prototype machine did not work upon arrival on Gonghsa. [[Sunjun\|Sunjun]] determined that the issue was related to the power supply, which Gyundok was hesitant to believe at first. After accepting Sunjun's analysis, Gyundok ordered Sunjun and [[Honam\|Honam]] to prime the machine, before the [[Fourth Torish scholar\|fourth Torish scholar]] offered.
[[Nikaro\|Nikaro]] was eventually able to summon a spirit, though the scholars' machine claimed it. As Painter watched the spirit be pulled away, Gyundok watched Nikaro and Yumi with concern, with their detection device in hand.
When [[Nikaro\|Nikaro]] and Yumi approached the scholars to destroy the prototype machine, they first encountered Gyundok. He called for Sunjun to activate their severing device, and as the other scholars worked he spoke amusedly with Nikaro about the [[Painter\|painter's]] understanding of what was happening.
After Yumi and Nikaro were separated, Gyundok worked with the remaining scholars to resolve the issues in Gongsha Town and contain Yumi. He explained to Yumi why her destruction of the prototype machine was pointless, and when Yumi escaped, he chased her with the others to [[Torio City\|Torio City]], where Yumi's dominating will forced him to stand down.
