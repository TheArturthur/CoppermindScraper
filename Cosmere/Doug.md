**Doug** is a crew member of the *[[Crow's Song\|Crow's Song]]* on [[Lumar\|Lumar]]. Unlike other minor crew members that Hoid names 'Doug' for simplicity, Doug is her actual name.
At the time the *Crow's Song* attacks the *Oot's Dream*, Doug is sewing a pirate flag for the ship. She later raises the flag at [[Captain Crow\|Captain Crow's]] command when the *Crow's Song* attacks a merchant ship, resulting in their surrender.
