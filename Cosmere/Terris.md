## Etymology
Terris appears to be derived from the Terris infinitive verb *Terr* meaning *To Preserve*, which is also the ancient name for Preservation, referencing their veneration of Preservation and the importance of it to their culture.

## History
The Terris people have a long and varied history reaching across multiple eras of Scadrial. Their ancestors were created by [[Ruin\|Ruin]] and [[Preservation\|Preservation]] at some point after the creation of Scadrial, who came to populate the planet. It is not known exactly when Terris ethnogenesis occurred, however, but they are known to be a long established group by the time of the First Ascension.

### Classical Scadrial
During the late Classical Era of Scadrial, the Terris people lived in the Terris mountains and were subject to oppression by many different states and peoples, including [[Khlennium\|Khlennium]]. This has instilled a hatred for the people of these states, particularly amongst the younger generation, who believe their people were made like slaves to foreign powers. However, Khlenni culture still influenced Terris culture, and some Terris people traded with Khlennium and took on Khlenni fashion.
They gained Feruchemy at least two-hundred years before the First Ascension, though they possibly possessed it for far longer.
When [[Alendi\|Alendi]] came to Terris to stop the [[Deepness\|Deepness]] from consuming the world, they took him up into the mountainous regions to seek the [[Well of Ascension\|Well of Ascension]]. When they arrived, [[Rashek\|Rashek]] betrayed and killed Alendi and took the power of the Well for himself. After realizing that his Ascension had ruined the world, he set himself up as the protector of humanity, beginning the time of the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]].

### Final Empire
In the Final Empire, the remaining Terris population became subject to intense oppression by the state. They were selectively bred to reduce the Feruchemical abilities. Many being emasculated for the purposes of preventing them from having children. A portion of the eunuch population was trained and employed as stewards. Stewards held an unusual place in the final empire, and were given the title 'Vaht'.
The Terris people tried to retain their culture despite their oppression, and to preserve the memory of the cultures and religions that were destroyed by Rashek in his conquests and assimilation efforts.

### After the Collapse
After the fall of the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]], the [[Synod\|Synod]] revealed themselves and started leading their people back into the ways before the Final Empire. The Terris people swore they would never take another master or be citizens of another empire, allowing themselves to engage in self-rule. This was largely motivated by the memories of oppression under the Final Empire, and the breeding programs their people were put through, making them untrustworthy towards external powers. Due to this, many Terris people rejected the New Empire, not trusting it to allow them autonomy and freedom from oppression.

### Genocide
After [[Ruin\|Ruin]] was released, he took control of the [[Steel Inquisitors\|Steel Inquisitors]] and the [[Koloss\|Koloss]]. He sent some Inquisitors to the newly free Terris and slaughtered the Feruchemists. The remaining people fled the mountains and headed towards the central dominance, away from the deadly mists. They settled at the Pits of Hathsin.

### Post-Catacendre
Around one-fifth of the [[Originators\|Originators]], those who survived the war against Ruin and the Catacendre, were Terris. Many of the Originators taught their children the Terris language, and over time the language was revived from its dead state.
With the Lord Ruler's Terris breeding program and laws against intermarriage ended, the Terris were no longer an entirely isolated population in post-[[Catacendre\|Catacendre]] Scadrial. Feruchemical and Allomantic genes combined to allow for [[Twinborn\|Twinborn]] who have both [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]] and Feruchemy.
However, many Terris still maintained an endogamous culture of their own distinct from the majority of the society of the Basin. [[The Village\|The Village]] is a major Terris enclave in Elendel. A Terris Synod existed in the Village; this Synod had no official control over other Terris enclaves, and would claim to have more authority than it actually possessed. Due to their endogamy, mixed race people remained rare, despite the legalization of such relationships.
They came to be desirable on staff, and especially amongst political cabinets. This is due to the fact that many people believe that it looks good for them to have diversity in their staff, using them for public image alone. Some Terris people have pointed out how this is merely using them as a medal.

## People
The Terris people are recognized for their darker skin, but it doesn't tend as dark as one would find on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] or [[Taldain\|Taldain]]. Their characterization as being dark-skinned is not accurate, as they vary wildly between shades and tones. They have more diversity in skin tone than those of [[Central Dominance\|Central Dominance]] heritage. Due to these factors, it is difficult to tell a Terris person by their skin tone alone. However, in the Post-Catacendre era, due to a mixture of their endogamy, and the fact that most dark skinned people who survived the Catacendre were Terris, they became more associated with darker skin.
At least some Terris people are black haired.
They are also, notably, a rather tall people. Terris people often have a willowy build. Ancient paintings, during the post-Catacendre era, show Terris people with exaggerated elongated features. Some Terris women wear their hair in a braid, and some men keep their head shaved.
[[Feruchemy\|Feruchemy]] is passed down through Terris bloodlines.


## Culture
Many Terris people wish to stay isolated in order to maintain their cultural and genetic heritage. In fact, many choose to marry among their own people instead of marrying those of other ethnicities. Some Terris people are exclusionary towards mixed-race people.
They are known to be a rather reserved people, with a strong emphasis on order and stability. They value respectful dignity, meekness, ubmission, and being candid. Following from this, their speech patterns try to avoid offence, and often indicate uncertainty. Various Terris people see their culture as inherent to the Terris people, and see those who adopt the Imperial culture to be denying who they are.
Some believe that Old Terris still remains in the world, left by Harmony as a promised land for them to discover.

### Clothing
The [[Tinningdar\|tinningdar]] is a common robe worn by the Terris people distinguished by a colorful overlapping V pattern down the front. This pattern is often embroidered. The tinningdar is often worn alongside a belt, and has long sleeves. New versions of the Tinningdar, created around the year 342 [[Catacendre\|PC]], are more daring. During the Final Empire, these were often known as "steward's robes." During this era, the colors of the robe represent the colors of the House the steward serves. The Tinningdar is only worn by adults and old youths, younger children tend to wear simple white smocks.
Other Terris forms of clothing are also known to be colorful, and often incorporate the traditonal V-pattern. It is also common to wear colorful caps.
Khlenni fashion became popular in late Classical Scadrial, brought into Old Terris via trade between the two nations.

#### Jewelry
They tend to wear a large amount of jewelry such as rings, earrings, and other pieces of jewelry. During the Pre-Catacendre era, it was common to practice ear stretching, to accommodate for more or larger earrings.

### Language
The Terris language died out due to the assimilation efforts of the Lord Ruler, though records and knowledge of it remained amongst Keepers. Following the Catacendre, many were taught the language in their youth, allowing for it to, over time, be revived.
The language is known to have at least three gendered third-person pronouns, with at least one gender-neutral pronoun.

*Vaht-* A title for a Terris steward
*Terr-* To Preserve
*Kredik Shaw-* Hill of a Thousand Spires
*Shanwan-* Secret
It is common practice in the Terris language, and in Terris culture, to say "I think" often, as shown by Sazed. They often also speak in complex compound sentences, and frequently hedging to indicate uncertainty. This avoidance of offending with language is a known Terris speech pattern.
They have long vowels, and it is common for the first vowel in a name to be long.
The Terris *a* is somewhere between harsh and soft.
Due to their familiarity with iron, they have seven different words to describe it.

### Religion
Much of what was known about Terris religion was lost upon the Ascension of the Lord Ruler as he attempted to assimilate everyone to the imperial faith. However, the Terris people continued to try and remember their old practices, and over time managed to uncover more of their ancestral faith.
They believed in a set of texts known as the Terris Prophecies, passed down from their god, Preservation, in order to stop Ruin and protect the world. The central idea behind the prophecies is that, eventually, a savior known as the Hero of Ages would arrive and use the power sealed in the [[Well of Ascension\|Well of Ascension]] to save the world. This legend was also present to some degree in Khlennium, where the called this prophesized saviour the Rabzeen.
[[Realmatic theory\|Realmatic theory]] was part of the ancient Terris religion.
The Terris term for [[Preservation\|Preservation]] was "Terr" as it meant "to preserve" in their language.

#### Post-Catacendre Religion
>â*...Metal is your life. Metal is your soul. You preserve us, and so we will be yours.*â
\- Tellingdwar giving the evening recitation[28]

Post-Catacendre religious practices changed from the pre-First Ascension practices. Though they continue to worship Preservation, who they believe preserves them and their people. They do evening recitations of worship for Preservation.
[[Fortune\|Fortune]], [[Investiture\|Investiture]], [[Identity\|Identity]], and [[Connection\|Connection]] are major catechisms of both Feruchemy and Terris belief. Though they do not teach what all of these do, holding them to be beyond human understanding, much like God.

### Feruchemy
Terris culture treats Feruchemy with great reverence, leading to traditionalists refusing to use their powers for pay. This has led to for-hire Feruchemists being rare.

### Food
Little is known about Terris food, but it is likely similar to Mediterranean food and probably involves noodles.

### Terris Fundamentalists
There is a group referred to as Terris Fundamentalists who live in the mountains of post-Catacendre Scadrial. They appear to return even closer to their cultural and ancestral roots than the other Terris enclaves around the Basin.

## Settlements
The capital of the Terris Dominance is [[Tathingdwen\|Tathingdwen]], and there are also a lot of small villages across the Dominance.
By 341 PC, the Terris live throughout the Elendel Basin, and within cities such as Elendel. These settlements, even the enclaves, have a degree of autonomy granted to them by the government, allowing the Terris to police themselves without the interference of the local constabulary. The Terris settlement in Elendel is known as [[The Village\|the Village]].
