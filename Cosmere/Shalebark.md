>“*Clusters of a bulbous variety of shalebark grew along the inside, bursting with a variety of bright colors. Oranges, reds, yellows and blues. Some outcroppings looked like heaps of clothing, with folds spread like fans, others grew out like horns. Most had tendril like threads that waved in the wind.*”
\-Description of shalebark at Roshone's estate[1]


**Shalebark** is a class of organisms native to [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. Though it comes in many forms, it always has a rocklike appearance with retractable tendrils. Shalebark grows wild in diverse locations, from the relatively barren [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] to the jungles growing on the [[Tai-na\|Tai-na]] in the [[Reshi Sea\|Reshi Sea]]. It is also cultivated and used extensively in landscaping across Roshar.
Although Rosharan scholars believe that shalebark is a plant, it is actually an animal similar to coral.

Shalebark has a hard exterior that is easily mistaken for stone. They grow in various shapes including flat, bulbous, knobby, and folded; because they grow in clusters or mounds, they often create formations that resemble other objects like hands, branches, or horns. Shalebark often exhibits vibrant colors, with orange, red, yellow, blue, green, and pink among the known hues. It can grow on a variety of surfaces and seems to be very hard to dislodge, as it can survive the violent floods in the chasms of the Shattered Plains. Some species may also grow underwater.
The living animals inside shalebark have retractable tendrils that emerge from pores. The tendrils usually look like thread or hair, but some are fan-shaped. The tendrils are flexible, and are commonly seen waving in the wind. They are also colorful, and are not necessarily the same color as the protective outer shell. The tendrils have presumably evolved to retract in order to protect themselves during [[Highstorm\|highstorms]]; this is a common adaptation on Roshar. They will also retract if someone gets too close to them. Depending on the species, the tendrils may come out at a certain time of day. Shalebark typically grows in such a way that the tendrils are able to reach towards light.
Shalebark is known to grow best in warm temperatures. In the [[Reshi Isles\|Reshi Isles]], vast fields of wild shalebark growing in huge mounds can be found.
It produces an oil that can be extracted, known simply as shalebark oil.

### Symbiosis
Some varieties of shalebark have formed symbiotic relationships with other fauna. For instance, a snail that Shallan colloquially refers to as a "shale snail" has evolved a flat shell that closely resembles the blue and yellow coloration of a common species of shalebark known as 'plated stone'. The snails clean moss and lichen from the shalebark, and can quickly camouflage themselves in the shalebark if threatened. A knobby form of shalebark with fingerlike protrusions has tiny [[Cremling\|cremlings]] that are colored to blend in with the protrusions. The cremlings appear to serve a similar cleaning function as the snails.
Lifespren are often found drifting around shalebark.

## Cultivation
>“*The crusty, hard plants had no true stalks or leaves, just waving tendrils like colorful hair. Except for those, shalebark seemed more rock than vegetation. And yet, scholars said it must be a plant for the way it grew and reached toward the light.*”

Shalebark is widely used in landscaping across Roshar by both humans and [[Singer\|singers]]. Gardeners shape it by filing it down; painting it with sap can encourage it to grow in particular directions. It is used to line paths and to form ridges and walls, and it can also be grown in simple rows. In the cooler climate of eastern Roshar, shalebark grows relatively slowly, and it can take years to cultivate large ridges. Heating [[Fabrial\|fabrials]] can help, but the growth may still be stunted, with few lifespren attracted to the shalebark.
It is unclear how shalebark reproduces, but gardeners sometimes use small "starters" when attempting to create a new patch.

## Uses
Shalebark is usually cultivated as if it were an ornamental plant. However, due to its hardy structure, it can also be considered more of a permanent architectural element; it is used to add color and texture to buildings. It is commonly seen in and around palaces and mansions, and the wealthy may import different exotic varieties from other parts of Roshar to add variety to their gardens.
Because shalebark can be shaped, it can be used to create sculptures. In [[Kharbranth\|Kharbranth]], there is a hedge maze where the hedges are formed of shalebark. It can also be used to create more mundane items, such as benches or railings.
Oil can be extracted from shalebark; when added to the drinking water of [[Chull\|chulls]], it can help discourage pupation.
Although shalebark does not have true "leaves", pieces of it are used to fletch arrows by both humans and singers since feathers are very rare on Roshar.

## Trivia
Shalebark's description and appearance are highly reminiscent of real-life species of stony coral such as *Acropora hyacinthus* and *Montipora aequituberculata*. This is intentional, as "coral reefs above water" was a key element of Brandon's original vision for Rosharan flora and fauna.
