## Economics and Culture
Brick's tavern is where [[Brick\|Brick]] makes his ale, which is considered to be some of the best in the region, to the point that sailors will often visit to get it, and merchants will purchase it in barrels. There are generally two crowds that patronize Brick's tavern in the evening. The happy and boisterous crowd that are often roaring, cheerful and festive. Then, as the evenings tend to drift, there is the colder, darker and quieter crowd, who desire company, rather than companionship. Brick keeps his tavern open until 2 a.m.

### Darts
The men that frequent [[Brick\|Brick's]] tavern regularly play darts, though with slightly unusual rules. After discovering that with the way the grain in the wood wall looked above the dartboard, it almost looked like an image of [[Charlie's father\|the duke]]. That meant the two knots in the wood below the dartboard could be interpreted as the testes of the duke, and thus were the real target for the game. A good dart throw will result in winces from any witnesses.
