The original plan was for the city to stretch down several levels, and the Diggers carved out multiple layers with tunnels and rooms. These places became home to many of the lower class people, and during the time when the Diggers were active, people poured into the city for work.

Digzone's fate since the Diggers' madness is unknown.
