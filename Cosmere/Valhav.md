## Geography
### Territories and Features
#### Territories
Valhav lies in the middle and eastern part of [[Roshar\|Roshar]], stretching from the [[Purelake\|Purelake]] in the west to [[Alethela\|Alethela]] in the east. To the east, it borders [[Alethela\|Alethela]] while to the north, it borders the kingdom of [[Rishir\|Rishir]]. It also borders [[Makabakam\|Makabakam]] in the south. It is located very close to a number of islands belonging to [[Rishir\|Rishir]] and [[Thalath\|Thalath]], in the north and south respectively. It also borders the [[Tarat Sea\|Tarat Sea]] to the south and [[Makabakam\|Makabakam]] to the south-west. It also borders Sela Tales in the west.

#### Geographic Features
Valhav is home to the [[Horneater Peaks\|Horneater Peaks]], a large mountain range that contains hot springs at the tops, allowing for life to thrive. Valhav also controls a small part of the Purelake. The nation also has a number of great rivers running through it, most of which run either north or south and end in the Reshi or the Tarat seas. Valhav also claims a small part of the Ur Mountains.

## Culture
#### Ethnicity and people
Valhav has a variety of peoples. Most of them have pale skin and violet eyes. Although many people, particularly in the south of the nation, look more like their neighbours, the Alethelan people. These are generally tan with dark, typically black hair. Some people are even darker skinned then the Alethelan people. The men living in the Horneater Peaks also have pale skin, but are tall of stature, and often have red hair.

#### Writing and language
It can reasonably be assumed that the people of Valhav spoke a distant ancestor of modern day Veden. This language belongs to the [[Vorin\|Vorin]] language family, which also contains the languages of the Alethi, the Thaylen, the Natan, and the Herdazian peoples. The Unkalaki living in the [[Horneater Peaks\|Horneater Peaks]] speak a different language, which belongs to the Dawnate language family. The people of Valhav wrote in the [[Dawnchant\|Dawnchant]]. After a while, they adapted the original Dawnchant script to fit their own language and developed their own script. This process began with simple phonetic substitution, in which they used the Dawnchant to transcribe their own language.

## History
### Creation of Roshar
The land that would become known as Valhav was created at an unknown point before the [[Shattering\|Shattering]] by [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]], along with the rest of Roshar and the Rosharan supercontinent over ten-thousand years prior to Vorin year 1174. It is unclear how much the geography of Valhav has changed compared to the land at creation.

### Pre-Human Arrival
Before humanity arrived on Roshar from Ashyn, the land that would come to be known as Valhav was inhabited by [[Singers\|Singers]].
Circa -5825 in the Vorin calendar, humanity arrived on Roshar after fleeing Ashyn and were granted the land that would become [[Shin Kak Nish\|Shin Kak Nish]]. After less than a generation, they headed an invasion, slaughtering some of the Singers and expelling them from their land, claiming it as their own, this included the land that would come to be known as Valhav. This history was lost to man until the discovery of the [[Eila Stele\|Eila Stele]].

### The Establishment of Valhav
  Map of the Silver Kingdoms
Valhav was founded in the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]] Epoch. Due to the Desolations, the people of Valhav were constantly returned back to early technological levels, often to the point of having to make use of stone tools. Though they advanced each time with the help of the Heralds whenever they returned, often receiving this assistance from [[Kalak\|Kalak]] and his [[Willshapers\|Willshapers]]. Old manuscripts and texts dating back to these times mention quick-spreading diseases in the east that killed tens of thousands, and it is likely that at least some of these diseases spread to Valhav.
Very early in the nation's history, the city of [[Vedenar\|Vedenar]], then known as Veden city, was created and made into its capital. Vedenar was eventually made into the home of the Valhav Oathgate.

#### Further Desolations
The Sixth Epoch lasted at least thirty-one years, and likely significantly longer, before its Desolation arrived.
One of the many Desolations that struck the nation, along with the rest of Roshar, arrived in the year 337 of the Eighth Epoch. This Desolation was heralded by the release of [[Midnight Essence\|Midnight Essence]] in a small settlement in [[Natanatan\|Natanatan]]. The length of this Desolation is unknown.
Another Desolation occurred later and ended circa -3333, during an unknown Epoch. This left society wounded and weak, forcing them into a period of recovery.

#### The Last Desolation (c.-3332)
The Last Desolation was a large scale Desolation which occurred circa -3332, around 4500 years before the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]]. This Desolation was particularly devasting due to the fact that it happened only a year after the previous Desolation, and thus society was weakened and still recovering. Tired of the Desolations and their torture on Braize, the nine Heralds still on Roshar refused to return to Braize, leaving Taln as the sole Herald on the planet for millennia.
After the Last Desolation, Desolations ceased to ravage the nation. Due to this, society was able to advance much further than ever before, giving them the strength to potentially resist any potential Desolation without complete societal collapse. The era heralded by the Last Desolation came to be known as the Era of Solitude.

#### After Aharietiam
At some unknown point in history, after Aharietiam, Valhav collapsed. 4500 years after the Last Desolation, the area that was Valhav had fractured into multiple kingdoms, although the largest part was governed by [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]].
