**Dansic** is a land on the [[Earth (Frugal Wizard)\|alternate medieval Earth]]. It is in the same region as [[Hordaland\|Hordaland]], [[Norweg\|Norweg]], and the [[Geats\|Geats]]. it was formerly independent, but was conquered by the [[Hordamen\|Hordamen]].
Presumably, it is this alternate dimension's version of Denmark.
