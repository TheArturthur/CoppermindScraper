Sometime during his [[Reunification War\|re-conquest of the Reaches]], Varion retook the planet. In the battle at Gallosect, Varion's forces had a two-to-one advantage, which he utilized by sacrificing fighters to keep the Gallosect flagship occupied while he took out the Gallosect gunships, so that he could then take the flagship from a distance. After Varion rebelled against the empire,  [[Kern\|Kern]] cited the battle at Gallosect IV to [[Dennison Crestmar\|Dennison Crestmar]] as a precedent for Varion not focusing his attacks on the enemy's flagship. Dennison, however, correctly concluded that something else was going on, as Varion did not have the numerical advantage in the present battle that he had at Gallosect IV.
