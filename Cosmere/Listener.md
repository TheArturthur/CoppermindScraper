\-Venli to Shumin[1]


The **listeners**, called the **Parshendi** by the [[Alethi\|Alethi]], are a [[Singer\|singer]] ethnic group on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. By the end of the War of Reckoning in the Vorin year 1174, they had a population of around 37 thousand individuals.
Prior to the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], they lived on eastern Roshar, near the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]]. During the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]], they inhabited the city of [[Narak\|Narak]], but after the arrival of the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]] and the start of the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]] the remaining Listeners left Narak, roaming around on the Shattered plains.

## Geography and Agriculture
#### Geography
The Listeners lived in the [[Unclaimed Hills\|Unclaimed Hills]], very close to the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]]. Some Listener families occupied the circular craters near the western edge of the plains, while others spent their lives living in the wilderness around these craters.

 by  Connor Chamberlain  Narak, the home of the Listeners during the War of Reckoning
After the assassination of King [[Gavilar Kholin\|Gavilar Kholin]] the Listeners fled to the Shattered Plains, after this event they began inhabiting the city of [[Stormseat\|Narak]]. After the end of the [[War of Reckoning\|war]] and the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]] the remaining Listeners roamed around the Shattered Plains for a while.

#### Agriculture and Animal Husbandry
The Listeners cultivate multiple plant species. Some of these species are rockbuds, while others are trees. They use the dried pulp from a species of rockbud to make paper. The Listeners also grow and prune Shalebark, although they do it for decoration.
They also practice animal husbandry and hunting. They have at times hunted [[Chasmfiend\|chasmfiends]], although the amount differs heavily through time. They have access to leather, although it is unknown what creature this leather comes from.

## Government
### The Five
#### Use and Function
The Listeners are ruled by five individuals, collectively known as the Council of Five, or simply the Five. It is unknown how these five Listeners are chosen. The Five seem to have absolute authority over the Listeners, although any decision needs at least a majority among the Five before it can be put into action.
The composition of the Five has changed over time as more forms were discovered. At first, the Five were all in [[Dullform\|dullform]], and later, after the discovery of [[Workform\|workform]], the members of the council were all in workform. When [[Nimbleform\|nimbleform]] was discovered, the Council changed to being made up of one member of each form. The Council had pondered whether to add another representative for each newly discovered form, but the discovery of [[Stormform\|stormform]] and the subsequent [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]] meant that there was never an opportunity to do so.

#### Composition
For a full list of those in the group, see Category: Council of Five.
|**Form**|**Name**|
|-|-|
|Dullform|[[Zuln\|Zuln]]|
|Mateform|[[Abronai\|Abronai]]|
|Nimbleform|[[Chivi\|Chivi]]|
|Warform|[[Eshonai\|Eshonai]]|
|Workform|[[Davim\|Davim]]|

### Military
#### Armament
Listener soldiers use Warform, this grants them strong carapace armor as well as increased strength. Though not as strong or resilient as someone with Shardplate, warform listeners are a real threat to regular human soldiers. Their strength allows them to use heavy weapons like battleaxes, hammers, and sometimes clubs and swords. They are also capable of jumping far enough to cross the chasms on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]]. The Listeners are also fond of bows and two-handed slings. Some Listeners carry large shields called [[Stormshield\|stormshields]] when going out into a highstorm, however it is unknown if this type of shield is also used in combat.
The Listeners had multiple sets of [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]] and [[Shardblade\|Shardblades]], they gradually lost all of them during the War of Reckoning however. Regular soldiers often wear simple garments that are tailored around their warform carapace. Some of them also wear long coates, although these aren’t worn into battle. The Listener general wears a cap on their skullplate and a tight red cloth as a cape. The Listeners believe that a man should be able to see his own death coming, and for this reason they dress assassins in white.

#### Tactics
A notable aspect of the listeners' combat strategy is their use of **warpairs**, pairs of warriors who fight side by side as partners. These listener warpairs move around the battlefield in coordinated maneuvers and attack enemy troops with heavy weapons from multiple directions.
Listeners also use two-handed slings to hurl head-sized rocks at Shardbearers, these rocks can quickly damage Shardplate, with a single blow being enough to make cracks in an unharmed section of Plate. The Listeners also use shortbows to harry and weaken their enemies.

#### Organisation and Hierarchy
The Listener army is divided into multiple divisions, each a hundred and twenty-eight in number. These divisions have their own name, and may sometimes be made up of of different forms entirely, an example of this is the Storm division, a division made entirely of Stormforms. During wartime the Listeners also have many warpair scouts, usually from a single division, roaming around, searching for any sign of their enemies. Near the end of the War of Reckoning the entire army was around seventeen thousand Listeners, or 133 divisions, strong.
The Listener military is commanded by a general, also called a warleader, who is also the warform representative in the [[Council of Five\|Council of Five]]. During the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]] [[Eshonai\|Eshonai]] served as general. Beneath the general are a number of lieutenants, it is likely that these lieutenants control a division each.

## Culture
### Families
Prior to the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]], the listeners were organized in tribe-like families that would vie for control of the ten cities along the western border of the Shattered Plains. Some notable listener families include:


The family of [[Eshonai\|Eshonai]], [[Venli\|Venli]], [[Thude\|Thude]], [[Bila\|Bila]], and likely also [[Rlain\|Rlain]]. They were thousands strong around the time Eshonai first met with King [[Gavilar\|Gavilar's]] expedition and boasted a noble heritage, though it had been many years since they had controlled one of the ten cities.


The second family approached by the First-Rhythm family after the discovery of warform in their attempt at unification of the listener tribes.


Known to have raided the Fourth-Movement family out in the wilderness, away from any city, in an attempt to steal their weapons. This action earned them the scorn of other families.


Once raided by the Pure-Song family in an attempt to seize their weapons.

### Songs

In order to remember their history and important skills the listeners remembered them via songs, each to the beat of a different rhythm of Roshar. These songs were practiced and preserved by a Keeper of Songs. The known songs are as follows:


[[Song of Histories\|Song of Histories]]
[[Song of Listing\|Song of Listing]]
[[Song of Making Paper\|Song of Making Paper]]
[[Song of Mornings\|Song of Mornings]]
[[Song of Revision\|Song of Revision]]
[[Song of Secrets\|Song of Secrets]]
[[Song of Spren\|Song of Spren]]
[[Song of the Fallen\|Song of the Fallen]]
[[Song of Wars\|Song of Wars]]
[[Song of Winds\|Song of Winds]]

### Language

essai -- human-lover (literally "hairy")
narak -- exile
neshua kadal -- Knight Radiant
ulo mas vara -- monster of the chasms/chasmfiend

long sleep -- the long span spent in dullform
lull -- the time the Alethi call "The Weeping"
Rider of Storms -- the Stormfather
stormpause -- the span between two highstorms
The listener language is descended from the [[Dawnchant\|Dawnchant]] and is related to the [[Shin\|Shin]] and [[Unkalaki\|Unkalaki]] languages. They measure time using the rhythm of peace, they use movements and half movements as units of time.

### Architecture
Prior to the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]] the Listeners were technologically behind the rest of [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. They lived in huts made from hardened crem over frames of shell, which were huddled on the leeward side of lumps of stone to protect from [[Highstorm\|highstorms]]. These buildings were fragile and would often be destroyed by highstorms, although the Listeners would simply rebuild them.
When a highstorm is close the people prepare their homes, this includes stuffing rags under their doors, shoving bracing boards into position and pounding large wooden blocks into their open windows. Before the start of the War of Reckoning some of the Listener families occupied the 10 circular craters near the western edge of the plains, but they were eventually forced to move to the center of the Shattered Plains.

### Freedom
Due to their history the Listeners value their freedom. During the War of Reckoning many listeners stopped caring about their origins. It is also important to the Listeners that everyone can choose their own form, and the [[Council of Five\|Five]] cannot command people to choose a form. Some singers hate trapping spren, instead they prefer to go out into the highstorms themselves and attract the proper spren.

### Crafts
#### Paper
The Listeners have their own unique way of making paper. They make the paper from dried [[Rockbud\|rockbud]] pulp following a harvest. These rockbuds are native to the unclaimed hills and shattered plains. Their paper is much rougher then human paper and varies in Color. Their paper is also textured and full instead of neat and sterile. They also have a [[Song of Making Paper\|song]] describing the process. This ensures that the Listeners never forget how to make it.

## History
### The Last Legion and Abandoning of the Gods
>“*The Last Legion, that was our name then. Warriors who had been set to fight in the farthest plains, this place that had once been a nation and was now rubble. Dead was the freedom of most people. The forms, unknown, were forced upon us. Forms of power, yes, but also forms of obedience. The gods commanded, and we did obey, always. Always.*”
\-Jaxlim to Eshonai[6]


 by  Petar Penev  A Listener army
The listeners were originally called the **Last Legion**, and like other [[Singer\|singers]] in the [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringer]] army, they followed the commands of the [[Fused\|Fused]], who were the listeners' gods. The listeners lived in somewhere called the **dark home** (but this might have been metaphorical for being under [[Odium\|Odium's]] influence, and not an actual place). The Last Legion was sent to fight in the farthest plains, probably the plains of [[Natanatan\|Natanatan]] and the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]].
One day the Last Legion fled, leaving the forms of power for dullform. Despite being thus crippled, it would lead to freedom from their gods. These listeners composed many songs to remember their history and forms, such as the [[Song of Listing\|Song of Listing]], [[Song of Secrets\|Song of Secrets]], and [[Song of Histories\|Song of Histories]] because they risked forgetting everything. They had only known how to transform into forms other than dullform and mateform with the help of gods. Modern-day listeners call this period "the long sleep." 
Since the listeners recall this story about throwing off the Fused, this event must have occurred prior to or around the time of [[Aharietiam\|Aharietiam]], the Last Desolation, as the Fused were trapped in [[Damnation\|Damnation]] for four and a half millennia after that point.
Later, near the time of the [[Recreance\|Recreance]] and what was probably the [[False Desolation\|False Desolation]], the [[Unmade\|Unmade]] [[Ba-Ado-Mishram\|Ba-Ado-Mishram]] Connected to most singers, providing the singers with [[Regal\|forms of power]] and [[Voidlight\|Voidlight]]. The [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] sought to stop this threat by imprisoning Ba-Ado-Mishram. They succeeded but in doing so, stole part of singers' souls, turning them into slaveform. The listeners were spared from this event, and so it seems that they were not involved with the False Desolation. They became the only singers on Roshar with their minds still intact. The listeners inhabited the broken kingdom of Natanatan and the Unclaimed Hills in eastern Roshar for long time, unknown to most humans. For much of this, they knew only dullform and mateform, but eventually discovered workform.

### Alethi Discovery
To modern humans, the listeners were originally discovered by Alethi [[Gavilar\|King Gavilar's]] brother [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] during a hunting trip. Dalinar was scouting in a forest that wasn't on any maps, in a valley south of the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] and about two weeks' march from the [[Drying Sea\|Drying Sea]]. There, he found Eshonai, exploring. She led the humans to her family's camp. In that same day, [[Venli\|Venli]] had discovered that [[Painspren\|painspren]] may be the key to discovering warform, but her discovery was overshadowed by her sister's.
At first, the Council of Five only let a few listeners come to meet the Alethi, afraid of frightening them. Slowly, some of the listeners, including Eshonai, began to learn the Alethi language. The Alethi were very interested in the listener's ancient weapons and in the chasmfiends. Due to a mistake in translation, the Alethi started believing that the listeners worshipped the chasmfiends. The listeners were very intrigued by the Alethi's parshmen, believing they had no souls. The Alethi called the listeners the "Parshendi", or *parshmen who can think*. They gave many steel weapons to Eshonai's family, wanting them to take one of the cities at the edge of the Plains.
In the next human visit, Eshonai and Venli's family had already taken one of the cities at the border of the Shattered Plains. Venli had made no more progress in discovering warform. One of the Alethi, [[Axindweth\|Axindweth]], gave a gemstone to Venli with [[Ulim\|Ulim]] trapped inside, saying it might help her cure Jaxlim. Venli broke the gemstone, and started talking with Ulim. Ulim helped Venli cut a gemstone so that it glowed more brightly, and trap a painspren in it. She made about two dozen gemstones with painspren, and gave them for listeners to adopt warform. One of those was Jaxlim, but since Jaxlim didn't adopt the proper mindset for the form, Eshonai, who was acompanying her, took the form instead.
After the storm in which they adopted warform, another family attacked them. So, the warform listeners and the family's Shardbearer went out and told them to unite with their family, in order to show the humans an united nation when they next came to the Shattered Plains. They went to dozens of families with their proposal of unity, and they all gathered in Eshonai and Venli's city. Venli told Ulim to have his contacts among the humans make Gavilar bring listeners to the human cities, hoping to intimidate the other listeners and convince them to take forms of power.
However, upon visiting the human cities, the listeners weren't intimidated; they liked the city, and enjoyed themselves there. They signed a treaty with the humans, and there was a party to celebrate it. That day, [[Nale\|Nale]] approached Venli, saying Gavilar was going to betray the listeners and that Venli had to assassinate the king to stop him. That gave Ulim the idea of killing the king to drive the humans to attack the listeners, to intimidate them. At the same time, Gavilar indicated to Eshonai that he wanted to bring back the listener gods. Since the Council of Five feared their gods' return, they voted and decided to kill the king to stop him. Ulim had guided [[Klade\|Klade]] to buy [[Szeth\|Szeth]], so they sent Szeth and he killed Gavilar. The assassination led to the formation of the Alethi [[Vengeance Pact\|Vengeance Pact]] and caused the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]], a prolonged war between the listeners and the Alethi on the Shattered Plains.

### War of Reckoning
During the war, the listeners moved their population to the city at the center of the Shattered Plains. They named the city [[Narak\|Narak]], meaning exile, because they were trapped there after the humans moved to the cities at the edge of the Plains. With help from Ulim, Venli discovered nimbleform, though it still took her several tries to do it. The war of attrition lasted for six years, and the listener population slowly dwindled.
In the meantime, Venli worked to discover stormform. When cutting gemhearts to make them brighter, her scholars secretly saved pieces of the gemstones to store spren. The main problem Venli was trying to solve was how to draw the stormspren to the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]]. She eventually discovered that lightning pulls the spren through, and managed to trap the spren. Venli brought the form to the Five, and they agreed, though Eshonai insisted she should be the one to try the form, because Venli was too valuable with her knowledge of the forms.
Eshonai took the form, and when she returned to the Five, she proposed to transform every listener to stormform, to summon a storm against the Alethi. However, [[Zuln\|Zuln]] didn't agree, and she convinced [[Abronai\|Abronai]] to disagree as well. So, Eshonai went to the listeners and proclaimed that the Five could not forbid someone from taking a form if they wished to, and that she would take everyone who wished and transform them into stormform. She gathered the people that refused to transform, and put Thude to guard them. They fled into the chasms, and Eshonai let them, because they would be killed in the next highstorm.
At the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]], where Highprince [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] led an expedition to end the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]], the listeners in stormform sung a terrible song. It formed the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]] and with it, the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]] began.

### The True Desolation
Shortly after the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]], the [[Fused\|Fused]] began to take listener bodies. It seemed that they transformed every single listener into a Fused, except for Venli, who was chosen by Odium to remain alive, taking envoyform; however, it was later discovered that others survived, specifically [[Rlain\|Rlain]], [[Thude\|Thude]], [[Jaxlim\|Jaxlim]], and some others who resisted the change to stormform.
Odium used Venli to tell the story of the listeners to the new singers, to inspire them and show them that the people who summoned the Everstorm are singers like them, not beings of legend. Instructed by Odium, she painted the listeners as an heroic group, sacrificing themselves to free the enslaved singers, to be the foundation myth of Odium's growing empire. However, Odium also feared the listeners, as the people who had rebelled against him, so he stopped allowing Venli to answer questions and instructed her to tell her story in a specific way.
