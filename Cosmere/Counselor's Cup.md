>“*The temple had the air of an old gaffer in his chair who hadn't the inclination to look higher than a fellow’s knees.*”
\-Wayne, who refers to the tavern as a temple[1]


**The Counselor's Cup** is a pub in [[Elendel\|Elendel]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].

## Appearance & Staff
It is located on Edden Way and is situated on an intersection, surrounded by taller tenancy buildings. The building is lit by gas lamps and has a picture of [[Edgard Ladrian\|Breeze]] hanging behind the bar. The [[Blue\|bouncer]] is possibly a [[Koloss\|kolossblood]].

## History
During a firefight, [[Wax\|Wax]] told [[MeLaan\|MeLaan]] to escape and rendezvous at the Counselor's Cup. He got sidetracked and sent [[Wayne\|Wayne]] in his place. When Wayne arrived, he sat and listened to the patrons' conversation, noticing that they were unusually morose. Enlisting the help of the barkeeper, he helped calm down the tension by mixing cocktails for each of the patrons. MeLaan was impressed by his efforts, and they drank together. Wax and [[Marasi\|Marasi]] arrived, and Wax interrupted MeLaan and Wayne's belching competition to discuss [[Paalm\|Paalm]]. MeLaan told them about the [[Kandra\|kandra's]] skills and motivations while Wayne and Wax built houses out of coasters and Marasi transcribed the conversation. Before leaving, Wax checked if the tab was paid and was surprised that Wayne had already settled it. They exchanged passphrases and left on their respective errands.
