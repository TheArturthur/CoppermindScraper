## Works
Dan's first published novel was **, published in 2009. Since then, he has written several sequels to that book, the *Partials* sequence, the *Mirador* series, the *Zero-G* series of audio originals, and several other stand-alone books.

## Collaboration
Dan has been a part of Brandon's writing group since it was created, and in that role has presumably provided significant feedback to Brandon on his books. The soldier [[Wellen\|Wellen]] in  and one of his descendants, the member of the [[Set\|Set]] [[Wellid\|Wellid]] in , are cameos for Dan; the constable [[Wells\|Wells]] in *Mistborn* Era 2 may be as well.
After Brandon wrote the first draft of *The Apocalypse Guard* in late 2017, he felt that the book wasn't working right and decided it put it aside and write the  for the published that was promised *The Apocalypse Guard* instead. He then reached out to Dan, who he considered "the best writer" he knew to see if Dan could help him fix it. As a result of their collaboration, the book got "weirder" and by late 2019, they considered it to be "pretty good," but it still had some issues and they decided to shelve it for the time being. In April 2021, Brandon indicated he might work on getting the book into shape between when he finishes the fifth book of [[The Stormlight Archive\|The Stormlight Archive]] and when  is ready to be released.
Brandon has also indicated that he would likely work with Dan on *Dark One: Prophetic Histories*, the audio novelization of Brandon's original *Dark One* outline. In August 2021, Dan commented that he was collaborating with Brandon on *Dark One: Forgotten*, a -style podcast about a journalist tracking a serial killer, and had finished work on the project.
In September 2022, Brandon and Dan revealed that Dan was going to be joining [[Dragonsteel Entertainment\|Dragonsteel Entertainment]] as Vice President of Narrative.
