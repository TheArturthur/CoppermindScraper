**Gnash the Slaughterer** is a [[Garqua\|garqua]] that lives in an oceanic fragment in the [[Nowhere\|nowhere]]. It is blue, thick as a man’s thigh, and has little flippered legs along its long body. Like all garqua, Gnash is a vegetarian, and particularly enjoys fruit.

## History
[[Spensa Nightshade\|Spensa]] and [[Chet\|Chet]] came across Gnash when sailing across the fragment on their way to the [[Broadsider Faction\|Broadsider]] base. It came up to [[Not-ilus\|their raft]] when Chet tossed a piece of fruit into the water with a rope around it. Gnash ate the fruit, and Spensa tightened the rope into a leash. Chet had Gnash tow them across the water by tossing pieces of fruit far ahead for Gnash to chase after. Though Chet didn't always throw a piece, Gnash kept going, expecting Chet to throw another one. When Spensa and Chet reached the end of the fragment, they set Gnash free and gave her some more fruit.
