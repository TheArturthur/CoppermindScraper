**Dominion** is a [[Shard\|Shard]] of [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]] once held by [[Skai\|Skai]]. After the [[Shattering\|Shattering]], she traveled to [[Sel\|Sel]] with [[Devotion\|Devotion]], where both were [[Splinter\|Splintered]] by [[Odium\|Odium]].

## Intent
Since Dominion was destroyed well before any other known events on Sel, it is somewhat unclear exactly how the Shard's intent would drive its Vessel to act. The only trace of her are her [[Splinter\|splinters]], [[Skaze\|skaze]], which are thirsty for power as a result of their relationship with the Shard, and driven to maintain influence over politics of [[Fjordell\|Fjordell]]. This suggests that Dominion's focus was amassing and maintaining control over others.

### The Dor
For more information, see [[Dor\|Dor]].
When Odium Splintered Dominion and Devotion, he trapped their power in the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]] to prevent them from gaining another Vessel. Since, unlike in the [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual Realm]], location exists in the Cognitive Realm, the power of the two Shards is trapped together as a giant, polarized storm of [[Investiture\|Investiture]] known as the [[Dor\|Dor]], which makes [[Worldhopping\|worldhopping]] to Sel very dangerous.
The existence of Dor has a profound effect on Sel, as rather than a single, planet-wide magic system, the planet has numerous ones, each making its home in a particular region, all influenced in some way by both Shards. An underlying similarity between all of them seems to be reliance on shape -- all forms of accessing the Dor are dependent on the user creating a specific shape, often based on the features of the land associated with a particular magic.
This tie between the location and magic also means that the user's physical position in relation to the system's home region influences the strength of the magic, and moving further away from its origin point will diminish its effects. Furthermore, in order to access a magic system, it appears one must be from the land associated with it.
Magic systems using the Dor include:

**AonDor** - the magic of [[Arelon\|Arelon]] and surrounding area; the ability to draw symbols called [[Aon\|Aons]] in the air to produce a variety of magical effects. Aons can only be drawn by [[Elantrian\|Elantrians]], people raised to power and immortality through the city of [[Elantris (city)\|Elantris]].
**ChayShan** - the magic of [[JinDo\|JinDo]]; through taking specific stances and forming specific motions with one's own body, the user can access Dor for increased strength, awareness, and possibly other effects.
**Dakhor** - the magic of [[Fjordell\|Fjordell]]; through chants, the bones of a Dakhor monk are induced to change shape, which grants them abilities such as increased strength, bodily transformation, and even teleportation.
**Forgery** - magic usable in the [[Rose Empire\|Rose Empire]], originating from [[MaiPon\|MaiPon]]; accesses Dor through creation of [[Soulstamp\|soulstamps]], which contain a specific shape that is then imparted onto an object, rewriting its [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual]] aspect to change its history and, through this, present behavior and appearance.
**Bloodsealing** - another Rose Empire magic, originating in [[Dzhamar\|Dzhamar]]; using human blood, Bloodsealers can create wards and animate skeletons of the dead.
### Skaze
For more information, see [[Skaze\|Skaze]].
The [[Skaze\|skaze]] are [[Splinter\|splinters]] of Dominion, and consider Skai as something of a god or parent. The skaze are in some ways an inverse of the [[Seon\|seons]], though they assume similar shape and size -- round, about as large as a melon. Unlike seons, they are all black, seeming to suck light from their surroundings rather than emitting it. They also lack an [[Aon\|Aon]] in their center; rather, they are ringed by a pattern of misty symbols. They are reliant on humans, though it's unclear precisely how.
Skaze are power-hungry and controlling. They maintain a heavy level of influence over the politics of [[Fjordell\|Fjordell]], and were at least partially involved in the plan to wipe out [[Elantris (city)\|Elantris]]. The exact powers they possess is unknown.

### Other
Dominion's Investiture seems to be allowing [[Wyrn (title)\|Wyrn]] [[Wulfden the Fourth\|Wulfden the Fourth]] some ability to see the future.

## History
 by  Heatherly 
>“*It is a pity about Aona and Skai, but they were foolish—violating our pact from the very beginning.*”
\-Endowment[19]


Little is known about the early history of Dominion. The Shard was created at the [[Shattering of Adonalsium\|Shattering of Adonalsium]] and taken up by [[Skai\|Skai]] who, for unknown reason, took it to [[Sel\|Sel]] alongside [[Aona\|Aona's]] [[Devotion\|Devotion]]. They were not heavily involved in the creation of local cultures; however, they still ended up passively influencing them. Eventually, [[Odium\|Odium]] came along and splintered both Shards, effectively killing them.
Following their destruction, the [[Investiture\|Investiture]] of Devotion and Dominion was pushed into the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]], creating the [[Dor\|Dor]]. Though this was done to prevent the power from ever finding its way into hands of sapient creatures again, it seems as though the Dor itself has begun to attain sentience.

## Influence
>“*May Jaddeth grant me success.*”
\-Hrathen[21]


Though the two [[Shard\|Shards]] of [[Sel\|Sel]] weren't directly involved in the human civilizations of the planet, the discovery of their powers drove their development regardless. The magic systems they inspired were fundamental in the development of local writing systems and languages, and heavily impacted the local cultures. In the present times, this influence is most pervasive in the form of [[Shu-Dereth\|Shu-Dereth]], the state religion of [[Fjordell\|Fjordell]], though its god [[Jaddeth\|Jaddeth]] is also slightly inspired by [[Devotion\|Devotion]].
Though it's unknown how much -- if anything -- of Devotion and Dominion's original self remains, they continue to have magical effects on Sel. As [[Dor\|Dor]], they make the Selish [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]] exceptionally dangerous to travel through. Their [[Splinter\|splinters]], the [[Skaze\|skaze]], continue to have political power over Fjordell.
During the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]], [[Harmony\|Harmony]] sends a letter to [[Hoid\|Hoid]], in which he expresses how troubled he is by Devotion's and Dominion's deaths, as he had not known that Shards could be [[Splinter\|Splintered]] in such a way.

## Trivia
In *Magic: The Gathering* colors, Dominion would be black/white.
Although Skai, and therefore Dominion, was often assumed to be male in the fandom, Brandon currently plans for Skai's pronouns to be she/her, though that is subject to change until canonized in a book.
