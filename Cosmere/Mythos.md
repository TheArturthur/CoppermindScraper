>“*There are potential allies out there. Moonlight's world, perhaps. Or the land of the aethers. Hell, maybe even Mythos.*”
\-Kelsier to Harmony[1]


**Mythos** is an off-world nickname used for a [[/wiki/Cosmere#Planets]] in the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]].
After [[Autonomy\|Autonomy's]] attack on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]] was repelled in 348 [[Catacendre\|PC]], [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] mentioned Mythos to [[Harmony\|Harmony]] as a possible source of allies, though he apparently considered it a less likely option than [[Sel\|Sel]] and [[Dhatri\|Dhatri]].

## Trivia
In the 2022 [[State of the Sanderson\|State of the Sanderson]], a possible series set on Mythos was mentioned as a minor project.
