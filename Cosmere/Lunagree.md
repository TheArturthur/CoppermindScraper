A **Lunagree** is a location above each of the twelve seas of [[Lumar\|Lumar]] where [[Aether spores\|aether spores]] pour down from one of the planet's geostationary moons.
Sailors on Lumar generally stay clear of Lunagrees, owing to the danger of getting close to airborne spores.

3 Notes


## Features
As the locations where aether spores rain down into Lumar's seas, they are bright and colorful. Below a lunagree, the sea is at a higher elevation than elsewhere - crews sailing ships close to one find their vessel going up an incline as they near a lunagree.

## Lunagrees
### Verdant Lunagree
The Verdant Lunagree is located close to [[Diggen's Point\|Diggen's Point]] in the [[Emerald Sea\|Emerald Sea]], visible from it between fifty and sixty miles away.

### Crimson Lunagree
While sailing the [[Crimson Sea\|Crimson Sea]], [[Hoid\|Hoid]] describes the Crimson Lunagree as "like a lava flow". Under the curse of the [[Sorceress\|Sorceress]], he also suggests that it looks like the moon is throwing up. Xisis's lair can be found close to the Crimson Lunagree, though an exact location nearby is not needed and just being close is enough to get a meeting with him.
