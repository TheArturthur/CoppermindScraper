*Reactor* was founded (as *Tor.com*) in July 2008 and renamed *Reactor* on January 23, 2024.

## Reception
[[Gardner Dozois\|Gardner Dozois]] called *Tor.com* "one of the coolest and most eclectic genre-oriented sites on the Internet". He felt in 2011 that its short fiction output that year was weaker than usual, but said it was still a fascinating place to visit. In 2014, *[[The Guardian\|The Guardian]]*'s Damien Walter remarked on a "digital renaissance" in short SF, and cited a new generation of online magazines, including *[[Lightspeed (magazine)\|Lightspeed]]*, *[[Strange Horizons\|Strange Horizons]]*, *Tor.com* and *[[Escape Pod\|Escape Pod]]*, as having transformed the genre. Of these, he described *Tor.com* as "the reigning champion of science-fiction magazines". He noted the broad range of its output, and said that it had published "many of the most exciting new talents" such as [[Maria Dahvana Headley\|Maria Dahvana Headley]] and [[Karin Tidbeck\|Karin Tidbeck]].

## Awards
*Tor.com* has won eight [[Locus Award\|Locus Awards]] for Best Magazine (2015, 2017–23), breaking a 40-year-long streak where the category was only won by *Asimov's* and *[[F%26SF\|F&SF]]* (in addition to *[[Locus (magazine)\|Locus]]* itself). For its art direction, Irene Gallo received the 2014 [[World Fantasy Award\|World Fantasy Award]] for Professional Work.
There have also been several award-winning collections of *Tor.com* content. Reviews and commentary by [[Jo Walton\|Jo Walton]] were collected in the books *What Makes This Book So Great* and *[[An Informal History of the Hugos\|An Informal History of the Hugos]]*, with the former winning the 2014 Locus Award for Best Non-Fiction, and the latter nominated for the 2019 Hugo and Locus Awards. The fiction anthology, *Worlds Seen in Passing: 10 Years of Tor.com Short Fiction*, won the 2019 [[World Fantasy Award for Best Anthology\|World Fantasy Award for Best Anthology]].
