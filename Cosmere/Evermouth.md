**Evermouths** are giant green lizard creatures that call the [[Blackened Lands\|Blackened Lands]] on [[Mirandus\|Mirandus]] home.

## Appearance and Anatomy
Evermouths are large quadrupedal creatures, similarly sized to a horse. They have green skin, with plumes of reddish-orange hair behind their legs and on the back of the head down the back of the neck. They have orange eyes, and a large mouth that is able to swallow a human whole to slowly digest them.

## Behavior
>“*Be aware it will swallow you at the earliest opportunity. And then it will digest you for the rest of your lifespan.*”
\-Feotora to Paul Tanasin[1]


Evermouths roam the Blackened Lands in packs, hunting for food. They will hunt after prey over large distances, covering the ground faster than a mounted person can.
Paul Tanasin is somehow able to subdue a lone Evermouth that he comes across not long after appearing on Mirandus. He is able to keep and control the Evermouth as a mount, like one would a horse.
