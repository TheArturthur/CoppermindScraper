## Attributes and Abilities
Da and his wife [[Ana\|Ana]] were of the second [[Nahn\|nahn]], a high ranking in the caste systems of [[Darkeyes\|darkeyes]]. They ran their own silversmith shop in Kholinar, and were considered important among darkeyes. It is unclear if Da was his given name or a nickname used by Moash.

## History
Shortly after Ana and Da's grandson was born, both of his parents died. Ana and Da took him in and raised him; Da gave him the name Moash. The name "Moash" originated with ancient [[Singer\|singers]], although it is unclear if Da was aware of the name's history. Moash grew into a large, confident youth. He came to feel out of place in Kholinar and he did not care to learn the silversmithing trade; his wanderlust led him to leave the city to work in caravans. Ana and Da encouraged Moash to find his own way.
Around 1166, while Moash was away, an imperious [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]] named [[Toralin Roshone\|Toralin Roshone]] became frustrated that Ana and Da's silversmith shop provided competition to one of his own shops. Roshone had connections to then-crown prince [[Elhokar Kholin\|Elhokar Kholin]] and appealed to him for a "favor". With [[Gavilar\|Gavilar]] and [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] away at the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]], Elhokar foolishly acquiesced to his friends's request and had the couple jailed on trumped-up charges. However, Elhokar did not realize that high-ranking darkeyes were full citizens with a right to trial. He knew that if the case moved forward to the magistrates, his corrupt act would be exposed, so he left them in the dungeon and intentionally ignored their paperwork. Ana and Da, who were around seventy-five years old at the time, died in the palace dungeons still awaiting trial. Moash did not learn of their deaths until he returned from his caravan months later.

## Legacy
When Dalinar returned from the Plains, he learned that Ana and Da had died because of Elhokar and Roshone's actions in what became a scandal known as the "Roshone affair". Dalinar argued for a relatively severe punishment, but Elhokar appealed to Gavilar for mercy, and Roshone was instead exiled from Kholinar to become the citylord of [[Hearthstone\|Hearthstone]]. Although Roshone was sent away so he "couldn't do any more harm", he antagonized the citizens of his new town, including [[Kaladin\|Kaladin's]] family. Kaladin was outraged when he learned of the circumstances of Roshone's exile.
Moash considered Ana and Da to be his only family, and believed their kindness got them killed. The pain of losing them shaped his personality and changed the trajectory of his life. Rumors about the Roshone affair spread, and Moash directly blamed Elhokar for his grandparents' deaths. His hatred of Elhokar caused him to participate in an assassination attempt that was narrowly thwarted by Kaladin. He eventually took his vengeance on Elhokar, killing him during the [[Siege of Kholinar\|Siege of Kholinar]]. Moash also knew of Roshone's involvement in imprisoning his grandparents, and later killed him as well. Although Kaladin vehemently disagreed with Moash's quest for blood, he was sympathetic about the plight of Ana and Da, and thought about them on several occasions.
