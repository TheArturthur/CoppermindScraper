## Appearance and Personality
[[Wax\|Wax comments]] that Max enjoys drawing, and he's seen playing with a [[Soonie pup\|Soonie pup]], but most of all he enjoys flying with his father. He is enthusiastic, as evidenced by the trip to the [[Malwish\|Malwish]] airship, and has always had a fascination for heights. He is also empathetic to the situations his parents find themselves in, giving Wax encouragement, even when he doesn't understand very well. He has also picked up a version of [[Wayne\|Wayne's]] habit of "trading" as evidenced by his theft of Malwish toilet paper in exchange for his poop.

## Relationships
### Waxillium Ladrian
Max enjoys spending time with his father, flying and playing the game he invented with the wicker ball with the metal inside it, and the two of them have quite a close relationship. Max is a large part of why [[Wax\|Wax]] is able to transition between his role as a lawman to being a senator and father, understanding that he no longer needs the thrill of the chase, and that he belongs in this new role.

### Wayne
[[Wayne\|Wayne]] is an uncle-figure to Max, and has taught him accents, telling him to use a certain one to annoy the senators. Wayne also mentions he reads books with Max sometimes.
