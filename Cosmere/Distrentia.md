>“*His Divine Majesty Susebron the Fourth died to cure the plague of distrentia that struck T'Telir fifty years ago*”
\-Llarimar to Lightsong[1]

**Distrentia** is an illness on [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]].
It is a disease of the bowels. A plague of distrentia hit [[T'Telir\|T'Telir]] fifty years before [[Siri\|Siri]] became queen of [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]]--circa 277--and the previous God King, [[Susebron the Fourth\|Susebron the Fourth]], died, giving up his [[Breath\|Breath]] to cure the plague.
When [[Lightsong\|Lightsong]] quipped that the God King had died to cure "a few tummy aches," [[Llarimar\|Llarimar]] disagreed, indicating that distrentia is severe.
