**Panatham** is a city in [[Babatharnam\|Babatharnam]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Geography
Panatham lies in central Babatharnam, west of the [[Purelake\|Purelake]]. It is presumably the nation's largest city during the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]] and it may be the capital, as it is the only city labeled on available maps.
The city contains one of the ten [[Oathgate\|Oathgates]] that are linked to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]]. The Oathgates are known to be ancient, implying that a city has existed in Panatham's location since at least the [[Heraldic Epochs\|Heraldic Epochs]].

## History
Prior to the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]], [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] discussed potential places that the [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]] could attack, as well as locations of strategic interest. He suspected that the [[Iri\|Iriali]] and [[Rira (country)\|Riran]] armies—who allied with the Voidbringers—may have captured Panatham and its Oathgate.
