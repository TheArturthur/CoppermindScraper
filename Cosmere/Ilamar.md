**Ilamar** is the cavalrylord for [[Highprince\|Highprince]] [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin's]] army on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Appearance and Personality
Ilamar is a [[Lighteyed\|lighteyed]] [[Alethi\|Alethi]] man; however, the red patches in his otherwise dark hair and his long red moustache imply some [[Veden\|Veden]] or [[Unkalaki\|Unkalaki]] heritage as well. He has a squat and compact frame. [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] considers him both a good soldier and a good friend.

## History
Around 1145, in [[Gavilar Kholin\|Gavilar Kholin's]] decisive battle against [[Highprince\|Highprince]] [[Kalanor\|Kalanor]], Ilamar and his group of fifty cavalrymen fought armed with hooks and ropes for attacking enemy [[Shardbearer\|Shardbearers]].
In 1173, Ilamar continued to lead the cavalry during the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]]. He notified Dalinar that the cavalry was ready to head onto the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] in pursuit of a [[Gemheart\|gemheart]], but [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas]] delayed the excursion, demanding to enter the Kholin warcamp to investigate an assassination attempt on the [[Elhokar Kholin\|king]]. Once at the location of the gemheart, Ilamar waited for Dalinar and [[Adolin\|Adolin]] to clear a plateau of [[Parshendi\|Parshendi]] before he led the cavalry across on bridges.
Dalinar conferred with Ilamar and [[Teleb\|Teleb]] on the battlefield about a month later before assaulting the [[Tower (Roshar)\|Tower]]. Ilamar died during the [[Battle of the Tower\|Battle of the Tower]] along with [[Havar\|Havar]], [[Perethom\|Perethom]], and six thousand more members of Kholin army.
