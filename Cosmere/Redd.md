**Redd** was a [[Skaa\|skaa]] [[Copper\|copper]] [[Misting\|Misting]] (aka a [[Smoker\|Smoker]]) in the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
He was a member of [[Kelsier's crew\|Kelsier's crew]], and was part of the first team that infiltrated [[Kredik Shaw\|Kredik Shaw]], as he could hide [[Mare\|Mare's]] use of [[Tin\|tin]] [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]]. Upon reaching the inner chambers of the palace, he was killed immediately by [[Steel Inquisitors\|Steel Inquisitors]] who knew that the team was coming.
Kelsier didn't believe that Redd could have betrayed him, as he had been informed of the infiltration attempt at the last minute, and instead blamed [[Mare\|Mare]]. [[Vin\|Vin]] suggested that someone may have pierced Redd's coppercloud, and proceeded to demonstrate that this was possible, proving that there may not have been a traitor among Kelsier's crew.
