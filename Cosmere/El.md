## Appearance and Personality
### Appearance
El has horns. At each rebirth, he removes his carapace and replaces it with metal. The metal heals and integrates into his body through a combination of [[Voidlight\|Voidlight]] healing and his own, currently unknown, abilities.

### Personality
>“*Humans are a poem. A song.For ones so soft, they are somehow strong.For ones so varied, they are somehow intense.For ones so lost, they are somehow determined.For ones so confused, they are somehow brilliant.For ones so tarnished, they are somehow bright.Radiant.*”
\-El's thoughts on humans[3][4][5][6][7][8][9]

El expresses an admiration for humans. He considers them strong, intense, determined, brilliant, and bright. He studies human art forms, including writing his own [[Ketek\|ketek]]. He looks forward to ruling humans, and sees them as effective weapons that channel their Passion. He at one point believed that humans should not be killed, but rather repurposed to further the goals of the Fused.
Other [[Fused\|Fused]], even one as powerful and dangerous as [[Lezian\|Lezian]] the Pursuer, are wary of crossing or complaining to him. He is willing to kill his own kind simply as a way to experiment with the effectiveness of [[/wiki/Lights#Anti-Voidlight]]. He finds joy in being feared, primarily by humans.

## History
At some point in the past, El suggested that humans should not be killed. He instead wanted to unite all of [[Roshar\|Roshar]] under [[Fused\|Fused]] rule for a future war. As punishment, his [[Rhythm\|Rhythms]] and title were stripped from him. Prior to this point, he had the title Vyre, which translates to He Who Quiets; [[Lezian\|Lezian]] considers it disrespectful that this title was later given to a human, [[Moash\|Moash]], though El himself does not appear to be bothered by it.
When El returned during the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], he began once again studying human art from the time he was on [[Braize\|Braize]]. He particularly notes the way humans depict Fused as [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]] in the centuries before the True Desolation. He wrote a ketek to celebrate the return of [[The Sibling\|the Sibling]]. El appears to have increased in favor when [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]] killed [[Rayse\|Rayse]] and took up [[Odium\|Odium]]. He likes that Taravangian was recently one of the humans that he admires. After Lezian's death in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], Odium accelerates his return to give El a suitable subject for testing [[Anti-Voidlight\|anti-Voidlight]]; El confirms its reported properties by using it to permanently kill Lezian.

## Musings
>“*I look forward to ruling the humans. I had my title and my rhythms stripped from me for daring insist they should not be killed, but should instead be reconditioned. Repurposed. Humans are weapons. We singers revere Passion, do we not? How can we throw away such an excellent channeling of it? I love their art. The way they depict us is divine, all red shades and black lines. We appear demonic and fearsome; they project all fear and terror upon us. To humans, our very visages become symbols. You find echoes of it even in the art from centuries before this Return. Watch them struggle. Witness their writhing, their refusal to surrender. Humans cling to the rocks with the vigor of any Rosharan vine. Humans are a poem. A song. For ones so soft, they are somehow strong. For ones so varied, they are somehow intense. For ones so lost, they are somehow determined. For ones so confused, they are somehow brilliant. For ones so tarnished, they are somehow bright. Radiant. And so I am not at all dissatisfied with recent events. Roshar will be united in its service of the greater war. And I will march proudly at the head of a human legion. They should not be discarded, but helped to their potential. Their final Passions. Yes, I look forward to ruling the humans. Nearly as much as I look forward to serving you, newest Odium. Who was so recently one of them. You understand. And you are the one I’ve been waiting to worship.*”
