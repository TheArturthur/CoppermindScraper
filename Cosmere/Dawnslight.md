**Dawnslight** is an [[Epic\|Epic]] in the city of [[Babilar\|Babilar]]. To the people of Babilar, he is practically a god. Due to his seeming generosity, he is loved rather than feared, though no one knows for sure if he even exists. Many people worship him and pray to him.

## Attributes and Ablities
Dawnslight's Epic powers allow him to make fruits grow faster, helping to feed the people of Babilar. He also causes the spraypaint in the city to glow and the radios to run without batteries. In addition, he also warms the waters of Babilar, keeping them from being too cold.
He can communicate with people in the city by causing vines to grow fortune cookies with messages inside them.
Dawnslight causes very sturdy roots to grow around the bases of the buildings. Even when Regalia is killed and the waters recede, not a single building collapses.
When he is not dreaming, he is aware of the world around him, but he sometimes has trouble distinguishing when he's dreaming or not.

## History
While Dawnslight was very young, and before obtaining his powers, he fell into a life-long coma. He turned Babilar into a fanciful paradise, turning his childhood dreams into reality. He was treated by a doctor in the same room as [[Regalia\|Regalia]].
Dawnslight briefly made contact with David when he's in Babilar, and later helped him escape from Regalia by turning off all the lights in the area. When Regalia caught up to David and attacked him with tendrils of water, Dawnslight used plant roots to soak up the water and stop her attacks.
