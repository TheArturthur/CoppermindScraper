## Geography
Herdaz is a coastal nation in the north-east of Roshar, covering approximately one million square kilometres of land. Most of its jagged coastline lies on the [[Reshi Sea\|Reshi Sea]], while a small part of it faces [[Steamwater Ocean\|Steamwater Ocean]] and the [[Bay of Elibath\|Bay of Elibath]]. From the south, Herdaz borders [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]] on two rivers and [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] on land. Across the sea, it is close to a number of [[Reshi Isles\|Reshi Isles]]. It lies around the same lattitude as Iri and Rira.
Most of the country is a series of long and narrow peninsulas jutting out into the sea, and a single larger one separating the island of [[Akak\|Akak]] from the rest of the Reshi archipelago. Their territory also includes a singular island of unknown name, situated north of Akak. The Herdazian interior appears to be rather flat, with a single major river dividing the western and eastern halves of the country, and a number of smaller, shorter coastal rivers. Though there are cities there, none of them are considered to be of global importance.

## History
>“*Herdaz? My aides say it is the traditional first step for an Alethi aggression.*”
\-Taravangian[5]


The area that would come to be known as Herdaz was once inhabited by [[Singer\|Singers]] before the arrival of humanity from [[Ashyn\|Ashyn]]. Shortly after humanity's arrival from Ashyn and colonization of the land that would come to be known as Shinovar, they began to violently expand and colonize land across Roshar, which included this land. Some Singers, in an attempt to fight back the invasion, turned to [[Odium\|Odium]] and became the [[Fused\|Fused]], whilst others refused Odium's power and remained simply Singers.
During the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]] era, what would come to be Herdaz was part of the kingdom of [[Rishir\|Rishir]], which additionally encompassed modern [[Reshi Isles\|Reshi Isles]] as well as northern [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]], [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] and [[Tu Bayla\|Tu Bayla]].
At some point, the people living in this particular region of Rishir intermingled with the remaining singer population, birthing people with a mixed Rishir and Singer heritage. Modern Herdazians still show signs of their ancient Singer heritage in their carapace nails and higher rate of asexuality compared to other ethnicities. It is uncertain when Herdaz became its own country.
Herdaz has a long history of conflict with the Alethi. It was one of the first conquests of the warlord [[Sadees\|Sadees]], though like many others, it did not remain within his sons' grasp after his death. Following this event, various other conflicts have occurred, with Herdaz becoming known as a traditional first step in Alethi aggression.
Much later, following [[Gavilar Kholin\|Gavilar Kholin's]] unification of Alethkar, a change of dynasties occured in Herdaz, and the new monarch began threatening the Alethi borders in an attempt to test them. The Alethi responded by sending armies led by the king's brother, [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]], who spent about four years campaigning in the borderlands, shaping the modern Alethkar-Herdaz border.
Prior to the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], it seems the country wasn't doing very well, as numerous Herdazians elected to leave it, with some only coming back from time to time while others never returned. However, it appears to have weathered the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]] without much destruction, as the [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]] focused on bringing down their neighboring states. When Dalinar contacted them to get their support for his coalition, they initially believed that he was trying to trick them into letting him invade them.
Following the fall of Alethkar, a number of Alethi forces withdrew to Herdaz in an attempt to mount an organized resistance, among them forces led by [[Sheler\|Sheler]] and [[Relis Ruthar\|Relis Ruthar]]. While most refugees have been folded under the command of the Herdazian general [[Dieno enne Calah\|Dieno enne Calah]], the cooperation between the two armies could get heated at times, as brightlord Sheler was captured and put up for execution after assaulting the local women.

## Government and Politics
### Government
Herdaz is ruled by an unnamed king from a new dynasty that has only come into power sometime before the year 1150. Little is known about him and his family, other than that he has no daughters. The kingdom has a single set of [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] and [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]] that are passed down through the royal line.
Herdaz might have at least one [[Soulcaster\|Soulcaster]], though the source on that is unreliable. It is certain, however, that there are no [[Oathgate\|Oathgates]] there.

### International Relations and Diaspora
#### Alethkar
Herdaz was conquered by Alethkar during the conquests of Sadees the Sunmaker until the instability following his death. They have been a typical first target in Alethi attempts at expansion throughout history, leading to a deeply bitter relationship between the two nations.
Their current border is shaped from centuries of aggression, particularly from the border conflicts occuring between 1150 and 1154, brought about by a change in dynasties in Herdaz. This, along with previous conflicts, brought about tensions even in times of peace between them, leading to them initially distrusting Alethkar when they approached them with offers to join the [[Coalition of monarchs\|Coalition of monarchs]] after the start of the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]].
At some point after their initial contact, Herdaz and Alethkar became allied in the war against [[Odium\|Odium's]] forces. However, tensions still exist between the two nations and people due to their history of conflict, and military and governmental authorities in Herdaz are quick to punish Alethi generals for crimes committed against their people.
A large number of Herdazians live in Alethkar as part of a wider Herdazan diaspora. However, due to tensions between their nations and general feelings of Alethi supremacy, they are victims of stereotypes and discrimination.

#### Elendel Basin
Following the True Desolation, some Herdazians seem to have migrated to [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]], with some known to have lived in [[Bilming\|Bilming]] selling chouta as of 348 [[Catacendre\|PC]]. How they are treated or thought about by wider society or by the government is currently unknown.

### Military
Little is currently known about the Herdazian military, however, it is known that they are strong enough to resist Alethi incursion and defend their territory. Furthermore, it is notable enough for Alethkar to quickly approach them with offers to join the Coalition of Monarchs after the start of the True Desolation. Though they are not considered to be of true strategic value.

## People and Culture
### Cuisine
Herdazian cuisine uses mostly a wide variety of shellfood, as well as flatbread. [[Chull\|Chull]] head is considered a delicacy. The most famous Herdazian dish is [[Chouta\|chouta]], fried [[Soulcasting\|Soulcast]] meat wrapped tightly in flatbread and topped with sauce, though sometimes the meat is replaced with shellfood.

### People
  <<Lopen\|Lopen>> with a <<Sparkflicker\|sparkflicker>>
Herdazians are a people of Ashynite and Singer descent, although which Ashynite ethnic group or groups they descend from is currently unknown. They are brown-skinned, darker than the [[Alethi\|Alethi]], but paler than the [[Makabak\|Makabaki]], and brown-haired. They are most similar in appearance to the [[Reshi\|Reshi]], to the point where they can be mistaken for them. However, they are also one of several races on Roshar with [[Singer\|singer]] blood in their ancestry, though it's not quite as apparent as it is among the [[Unkalaki\|Unkalaki]]. The most visible sign of their heritage are their crystalline, slate-colored fingernails, which are strong enough to start a fire with a proper tool, and are sometimes described as reminiscent of carapace. Apart from that, they have a higher tendency to be asexual than other races without singer ancestors.
Herdazians are rather tight-knit people. They have large families - a single person can easily be related to half the country - and will stick together, the bonds between them stronger than whatever country they happen to find themselves in.

### Religion
The majority of Herdazians appear to be adherents of [[Vorinism\|Vorinism]], though they practice their own variety of the faith. Herdazian Vorinism has various differences from orthodox Vorinism, for example, their doctrine permits male literacy.

### Language
The Herdazian language belongs to the Vorin family, much like Alethi and Veden. The language has, according to [[Lopen\|Lopen]], names for all the kinds of cousins. There are numerous words in Herdazian to refer to a person without using their name, all of which have slightly different meaning.

#### Terms
*calah* - An old Herdazian term for .
*chorlano* - unknown meaning, used by Lopen to refer to [[Huio\|Huio]]
*chortana* - a woman, possibly an intimidating or powerful one
*enne* - an old Herdazian honorific, roughly meaning "great."
*gancho/a* - a casual way to refer a male or female superior
*gon* - appears to be a generic term
*hooch* - Lopen uses this one for [[Sigzil\|Sigzil]], and refuses to explain its meaning
*hregos* - unknown meaning, used by Lopen to refer to [[Thaylen\|Thaylen]] sailors
*mancha* - [[Lopen\|Lopen]] sometimes uses this term when addressing [[Lunamor\|Lunamor]] and, on one occasion, uses it to refer to himself in his own thoughts
*misra* - unknown meaning, used by Lopen to refer to [[Cord\|Cord]]
*moolie* - A term for someone mute or quiet
*naco* - seems to be used for someone younger, like a child
*ornachala* - unknown meaning, possibly some sort of Herdazian food
*penhito* - an insult
*velo* - unknown meaning, used by Lopen to refer to [[Talik\|Talik]]
### Diaspora
>“* Gon, I haven't been to Herdaz since I was a baby. There are as many Herdazians in Alethkar and Jah Keved these days as there are in our homeland.*”
\- Lopen[11]


The Herdazian people are spread across a wide disaspora covering much of western Roshar. According to some reports, almost half of all Herdazians on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] don't actually live in Herdaz, but rather in the surrounding countries, particularly Alethkar and Jah Keved. As of 348 [[Catacendre\|PC]], part of the diaspora lives on Scadrial within the Elendel Basin, likely motivated by the dangerous situation on Roshar during the True Desolation.
The Push-pull factors that motivate Herdazian migration are currently unknown.
When a large group of Herdazians come together, they often form their own districts, such as [[Little Herdaz\|Little Herdaz]] in [[Highprince\|highprince]] [[Sebarial\|Sebarial's]] warcamp on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]]. Members of this diaspora population often retain their cultural practices and identity - among others, [[Chouta\|chouta]] is a Herdazian street food that gained much popularity in the warcamps, and can even be bought in [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]].
There are numerous stereotypes about Herdazians. Many Alethi believe they all wear [[Sparkflicker\|sparkflickers]], and more malicious ones claim they're all stupid, though both are repeatedly proven wrong. Across western Roshar, they are considered extremely boastful, and the women are said to be tough and difficult to impress, even in the opinion of their kinsmen. Herdazians are mentioned, by Alethi, as looking very similar to one another to non-Herdazians, to the point where they often cannot be told apart.
It is currently unclear if the wider Herdazian diaspora includes countries or areas other than Alethkar, Jah Keved, and the Elendel Basin in demographically significant numbers.

## Trivia
Herdaz's size is roughly similar to that of , or about half of .
Brandon created Herdazians after his wife noted that there are very few Hispanic cultures in fantasy worlds. In particular, some elements of Herdaz are inspired by Mexico.
