>“*The power they offer is something... Sublime and devastating at once. Dangerous because of what it could do in the wrong hands, yet somehow *more* dangerous in your own.*”
\-Wax and Marasi on the power of the Bands of Mourning[1]


The **Bands of Mourning** are the legendary [[Feruchemy\|Feruchemical]] bracers that were supposedly created by the [[Rashek\|Lord Ruler]] and could purportedly grant the wearer his powers. However, while they did grant all known [[Allomancy\|Allomantic]] and Feruchemical abilities, they were not actually made by the Lord Ruler, and instead, the [[Sovereign\|Sovereign]] was involved. "Bands of Mourning" is a misleading name, probably to prevent people from finding it; it is actually a spearhead. They are currently owned by the [[Malwish Consortium\|Malwish Consortium]].

## Description
The Bands of Mourning are an oversized, spearhead shaped object made of all of the Allomantic metals. The different metals are interwoven into the Bands of Mourning in wavy patterns, not unlike the folds of a pattern welded blade. When first found, they stored more power than any other [[Metalmind\|metalmind]] ever before seen.
They are a set of [[/wiki/Feruchemy#Unkeyed Metalminds]] and [[/wiki/Feruchemy#Unsealed Metalminds]] metalminds granting all Feruchemical and Allomantic abilities to their wielder.
This was possible because [[Nicrosil\|Nicrosil]] can be filled with [[Investiture\|Investiture]], giving the tapper the ability to burn metals and tap or fill other metalminds. The amount of Investiture was such that [[Marasi\|Marasi]] actually saw the [[Mists\|Mists]] emanating from her when she used it, and [[Wax\|Wax]] believes that his abilities are like the strong Allomancy of old while he is using it.

## History
The Bands of Mourning were created by the [[Sovereign\|Sovereign]] through unknown means at some point after the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]], then hidden in the [[Sovereign's temple\|Sovereign's temple]]. The museum at the center of the Field of Rebirth has a replica of the Bands of Mourning, even before the rediscovery of them.
After being re-discovered and subsequently used by [[Marasi\|Marasi]] and [[Waxillium\|Waxillium]], they were handed over to the [[Kandra\|Kandra]] for safekeeping to prevent disagreement over ownership of the bands between the government of the Elendel Basin and the Malwish.
Six years later, the government of Elendel comes to an agreement with the Malwish ambassador, allowing them to try and use the Bands to stop an incoming bomb. After [[TenSoon\|TenSoon]] hands over the Bands to the present representatives of the Elendel Basin, it is discovered that they had been completely drained of all powers, to the shock of everyone present. The Malwish ambassador reacts with outrage to this discovery, and demands to be handed the Bands as per their deal, as the attempt to stop the bomb was made and failed. After insinuating that the Elendel government may have used the Bands for their own purposes, he claims that Malwish scientists would be able to tell if the Bands handed to him were a fake, and leaves with them in hand.

## Trivia
Despite being incredibly powerful, it is not as heavily Invested as a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]].
