## Design
### Vindication
Vindication is a sleek revolver with a long barrel. It is made of a silvery metal called [[Invarian steel\|Invarian steel]], and it is highly polished. It does not use [[Aluminum\|aluminum]] in its construction due to cost. It has a grip styled with wavy lines of ivory and onyx separated by metal bands.
The gun has eight chambers and can be loaded with six ordinary bullets and two larger "hazekiller rounds" designed to fight [[Allomancer\|Allomancers]]. The gun will normally fire the six standard bullets and skip the two chambers that hold the hazekiller rounds. Pulling a lever on the grip and spinning the hammer locks it onto the additional chambers. Since Invarian steel is stronger and lighter than ordinary steel, it allows for thinner chamber walls, so the revolver remains reasonably sized. It also has an "Allomancer-only" safety; a hidden internal switch that only a [[Misting\|Misting]] or [[Allomancy\|Mistborn]] can see or access via an [[Iron\|ironpull]] or a [[Steel\|steelpush]]. The safety disables the gun, making it nearly impossible to turn it on its owner. Ranette later used a similar internal latch design on the third version of her grappling hook devices.

### Vindication II
At some point before 348 [[Catacendre\|PC]], Ranette designed a new version of Vindication for Wax, dubbed Vindication II. The second version is similar in concept to the first, but it is has an all-aluminum construction. It also uses aluminum cartridges and aluminum bullets in its "regular" chambers. The hazekiller chambers are activated with a lever on the top of the gun. Ranette also designed new hazekiller rounds that include a secondary explosion intended to forcibly eject spikes from [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgists]].

## History
### Vindication
Wax visited Ranette's shop in 341 [[Catacendre\|PC]] seeking a new [[Sterrion 36\|Sterrion 36]], after losing his [[Ambersair\|Ambersair]] revolver. However, Ranette instead showed Wax the hazekiller rounds and Vindication, which she had likely developed specifically for him. Wax was suitably impressed, and Ranette was unusually proud of her work; she named the gun after the Ascendant Warrior, [[Vin\|Vin]]. Ranette "loaned" Wax the gun and ammunition on the condition that he provided a field report. Wax—who referred to Vindication using female pronouns—usually carried it in his shoulder holster. He continued to carry (and use) other guns, but Vindication immediately became his primary weapon.
Wax used the gun against the [[Vanishers\|Vanishers]] when interrupting their train heist and it performed admirably; it was highly accurate, even allowing him to shoot a bundle of dynamite falling from the sky. However, Wax dropped Vindication in the resulting explosion. It was recovered by [[Marasi Colms\|Marasi Colms]], who searched the Vanishers hideout for it afterwards.
Wax continued to carry Vindication for the next few years. He successfully used a hazekiller round to injure the [[Marksman\|Marksman]]. He nearly shot [[Bleeder\|Bleeder]] with it at [[Lady ZoBell's party\|Lady ZoBell's party]] and later injured her using a [[Pewterarm\|Pewterarm]] round. As the search for Bleeder continued, [[Wayne\|Wayne]] picked up a single hazekiller-caliber bullet from Ranette that Wax had asked her to forge in such a manner that it would not shatter. During Wax's final confrontation with Bleeder, he temporarily lost Vindication, but he was able to retrieve it and shoot her in the head with the special bullet. Wax had secretly asked Ranette to forge the bullet with [[Wax's earring\|his earring]] so that it would function as a Hemalurgic spike and give [[Harmony\|Harmony]] control over Bleeder.
Wax wore Vindication to his interrupted wedding to [[Steris Harms\|Steris Harms]]. He used it extensively during the [[Set\|Set's]] attack on his train to [[New Seran\|New Seran]]. He carried Vindication throughout his time in New Seran, except when he had to reluctantly check it during [[Kelesina Shores's party\|Kelesina Shores's party]]. He used it again during the confrontations with the Set in [[Dulsing\|Dulsing]] and at the [[Sovereign's temple\|Sovereign's temple]].

### Vindication II
Although Wax went into retirement after the discovery of the [[Bands of Mourning\|Bands of Mourning]], he still upgraded his weapons. He kept them in a locked strongbox inside a locked cabinet in his home. In 348 [[Catacendre\|PC]] when he was pushed back into action to fight against [[Telsin\|Telsin]], he retrieved Vindication II and carried it as his everyday weapon alongside the . Wax used Vindication II throughout his mission investigating Telsin and the Set. The explosive hazekiller rounds worked as expected; a single shot obliterated the rear door of a truck. However, [[Getruda\|Getruda]] was able to heal from a hazekiller round to the face using her [[Gold\|gold]] [[Metalmind\|metalminds]]. During a subsequent fight, Wax deduced that Getruda likely kept metalminds in her arms and blew one of them off with another hazekiller round; this greatly slowed her healing, and she was killed by a Pushed bullet from Wax.
Notably, Telsin did not seem to have any fear of guns during this time, even Vindication. Harmony informed Wax that killing her might not be possible if she was adequately [[Investiture\|Invested]] by [[Autonomy\|Autonomy]], even if the hazekiller rounds took out one or more of her spikes.
