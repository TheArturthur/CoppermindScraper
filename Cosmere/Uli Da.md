**Uli Da** was the original [[Vessel\|Vessel]] of the [[Shard\|Shard]] [[Ambition\|Ambition]]. She is referred to as female in the [[/wiki/Letters#First Oathbringer Letter]] sent to [[Hoid\|Hoid]].
She is a [[Sho Del\|Sho Del]], one of three races on [[Yolen\|Yolen]], and thus a non-human Vessel.

## History
 Nothing is known about Uli Da's origins and life prior to the [[Shattering\|Shattering]], other than that she came from [[Yolen\|Yolen]]. For unknown reason, she and a group of others broke cosmere's creator deity, Adonalsium, into sixteen pieces. Of those sixteen, she took up [[Ambition\|Ambition]], and then made her way to the [[Threnodite\|Threnodite]] system.
For subsequent events, see [[/wiki/Ambition#History]].
