## History
 by  zoethatcher_art Nothing is known about Uli Da's origins and life prior to the [[Shattering\|Shattering]], other than that she came from [[Yolen\|Yolen]]. For unknown reason, she and a group of others broke cosmere's creator deity, Adonalsium, into sixteen pieces. Of those sixteen, she took up [[Ambition\|Ambition]], and then made her way to the [[Threnodite\|Threnodite]] system.
For subsequent events, see Ambition#History.
