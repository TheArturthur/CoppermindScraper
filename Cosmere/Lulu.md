>“*Is that what you told that bouncing bundle of breasts and booty you were dancing with at the party?*”
\-Megan to David, speaking of Lulu[1]


**Lulu** is a resident of [[Babilar\|Babilar]].

## Appearance and Personality
She is attractive, dark-skinned, and curvy, with lustrous black hair. She enjoys parties and dancing, looks down on the type of activism the [[Reckoners\|Reckoners]] engage in, and is rather flirtatious.

## History
Lulu was at the [[Party in Babilar\|party in Babilar]] with [[Calaka\|Calaka]], [[Infinity\|Infinity]], and [[Marco (Reckoners)\|Marco]]. She started flirting with [[David Charleston\|David Charleston]] as soon as [[Mizzy\|Mizzy]] introduced him to the group. She then danced with him for a while, but her flirting went over his head, as he spent the time comparing her to [[Megan Tarash\|Megan]]. Losing interest in him, she was taken by someone else to dance. Megan was observing the party at the time and saw David and Lulu dancing together. Later, David compared Mizzy's dancing with Lulu's. He considered looking for Lulu again to ask her about [[Regalia\|Regalia]], but in the end he decided not to.
