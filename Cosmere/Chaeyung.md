## Appearance and Personality
Chaeyung appears to be in her thirties and has a willowy figure with very short hair, which she wears in a bun.

## History
Chaeyung is from Torio. She eventually became an attendant of Yumi, under [[Liyun\|Liyun]]. Chaeyung has a particular talent for combing the tangles out of Yumi's hair without hurting her. Her duties included feeding, bathing, and dressing Yumi, as well as escorting her, fetching needs such as water, and performing various other acts of service. Following the activation of the [[Father machine\|father machine]], Hwanji was turned into a [[Nightmare\|nightmare]].
Chaeyung continued to attend Yumi over the centuries that followed, at the direction of the machine, until the time of Yumi and [[Nikaro\|Nikaro's]] bond. When Nikaro noticed a man's [[Flyer\|flyer]] operating strangely and inquired as to the reason, Chaeyung quietly explained that the creations of the scholars from the [[Institute of Mechanical Solutions\|Institute of Mechanical Solutions]] do not work as well as those created by a yoki-hijo.
