**Dzhamar** is a swampy region of the [[Rose Empire\|Rose Empire]] on [[Sel\|Sel]]. It borders the mountains of [[Mulla'dil\|Mulla'dil]].
Dzhamarians are very pale with milky-white (nearly translucent) skin, white hair, and red eyes. Their movements are somehow unnatural, and their appearance tends to give them an ageless quality to outsiders.
Dzhamar is the homeland of [[Bloodsealing\|Bloodsealing]]. Their magic is generally regarded as sinister by other nations, but the [[Grand\|Grands]] are not above hiring them.
Dzhamar was presumably once an independent nation, and it maintains a unique cultural identity as a constituent country of the empire. There is an intense hatred between the Dzhamarians and their neighbors, the [[Mulla'dil\|Strikers]].
