## Geography
Kilahito is located not far from the ruins of [[Torio City\|Torio City]], and it is of a comparable size. It is also only five miles from Yumi's prison, during her time of captivity. The city is laid out in a circular configuration, that is sometimes broken into different wedges and rings, crossed with asphalt streets wide enough for vehicles. Warehouse structures with white faces and no outward-facing windows circle the perimeter of the city, just inside of a perimeter road. The city is likely built around a [[Hion\|hion]] stub, and it is adjacent to a lake, which serves as the city's primary water supply.
While the machine is active, the [[Shroud\|shroud]] encircles the city like a dome, though following the battle of Kilahito the shroud dissipates. Due to fear of [[Nightmare\|nightmares]] during that period, poorer sections of the town are located closer to the perimeter. A pleasure district, as well as the narrow Rabble Way--a "low-end" merchant district--are located near the perimeter, and tend to be more active at night than the rest of the city. Due to the unending darkness of the shroud, "night time" is a matter of convention that the city generally follows. Other than the nightmares during this period of the city's history, the town is considered to be quite safe.

## History
An army of hundreds of stable nightmares were sent to attack Kilahito, to destroy Nikaro's knowledge about the machine. Nikaro and his companions organized a resistance among many of the city's painters, who fought the creatures at the [[Battle of Kilahito\|battle of Kilahito]]--preventing the nightmares from destroying the city. After the assault, the machine was destroyed and the shroud vanished, revealing the sun to the residents of Komashi.

## Culture
Crime rates in Kilahito are low, making it a relatively safe city, due in no small part to the nocturnal threat of nightmares.
While they greatly value the role that painters fill in society, they do not often discuss things such as salary increases, leading to painters earning very little money for the sort of work they do.
The people enjoy watching [[Hion viewer\|hion viewer]] programs for entertainment.
