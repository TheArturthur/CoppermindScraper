**Dragons** are a sapient species within the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]]. Originally, they came from [[Yolen\|Yolen]], but can now be found on other worlds (typically in very small numbers). They are one of Yolen's three sentient species, alongside humans and [[Sho Del\|Sho Del]]. Like the Sho Del, Dragons are a form of [[Fain\|fainlife]].

## Characteristics
### Greater Dragons
#### Biology

>“*She had another shape as well. Many of them, but one deeper and truer than the others.*”
\-Taravangian, on Koravellium Avast[8]


Most dragons in the cosmere are [[Fain\|fain]] creatures, and as such they are hexapedal, with four legs and two wings. They are inherently ageless, and therefore they stop aging after a certain point, but they are not unkillable. In their true forms, they are not necessarily large; some are smaller than [[Sandling\|sandlings]], while others can be as large as [[Chasmfiend\|chasmfiends]]. Their skin is covered with pearlescent scales, as well as silvery streaks of [[Dragonsteel (metal)\|dragonsteel]] that run along the body, mostly the limbs, up towards their horns, which are made entirely of dragonsteel. Even in this nonhuman form, they are still able to speak with a human-sounding voice. Despite being reptilian, they are able to grow hair across the head, and under the neck and chin as a beard. At least some of them are carnivorous.
Dragons have the inherent ability to shapeshift. The scope of their shapeshifting powers may vary by individual, but shapeshifting is a core aspect of their life cycle. Dragons are born in humanoid form, then transition into their draconic form upon hitting puberty, and eventually gain the ability to switch between those two forms at will. It is also likely that assuming a humanoid form is required for them to bear children. When in their humanoid form, dragons do not display any identifiable nonhuman characteristics. Their shapeshifting method is different to that of the [[Kandra\|kandra]], even if the result is similar.
Dragons appear to possess some form of intrinsic connection to [[Tamu Kek\|Tamu Keks]]; using a Tamu Kek, one may speak to a dragon, and the dragon can, in turn, respond and influence the speaker's emotions in some manner similar to a [[Brass\|Soothing]] or [[Zinc\|Rioting]].
Due to their highly Invested nature, dragons would struggle to use most [[Invested Art\|Invested Arts]].

#### Behavior
>“*The deal has been struck. I must pay you, however little I think the trade was worth.*”
\-Xisisrefliel[22]


Dragons are fond of bargains; in some cases, this can take the form of magical interactions that involve the dragon granting the petitioner a boon of some sort. They are likewise fond of collecting useful assets, which includes people, in form of slaves, followers or even corporate employees. They will frequently make themselves known throughout the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]], so as to plant knowledge of themselves that they can use later.
Aside from that, draconic personalities vary. Some take their self-appointed duties towards people extremely seriously; others devote themselves to scholarships; yet others simply do not care and do as they wish. Both [[Frost\|Frost]] and [[Xisisrefliel\|Xisisrefliel]] are shown to hold a non-interventionist policy toward humans in the cosmere, but this does not hold for all their kin.
Most dragons have at least two names -- a full, long name and then a shorter nickname they may use in some situations (for example, Xisisrefliel corresponds with some people using the name "Foil").
It is considered dangerous to disturb a sleeping dragon.

### Lesser Dragons
Aside from the so-called "greater dragons", the cosmere is also home to lesser dragons. Lesser dragons have some notable differences to greater dragons; they do not share the amphibian-like lifecycle of greater dragons, and are incapable of transformation into humanoid form. An unnamed planet is home to a variety of non-hexapedal lesser dragons known as **drakelings**. Lesser dragons have a much easier time using Invested Arts.
Nothing else is known about the biology or abilities of lesser dragons, and their relationship (if any) to greater dragons is unclear.

## Presence in the Cosmere
  <<Koravellium Avast\|Koravellium Avast>>, also known as the <<Shard\|Shard>> <<Cultivation\|Cultivation>>
>“*Though the vast majority of the people in the cosmere will never meet a dragon—let alone see one in their natural form—dragons do like to interact with mortals.*”
\-Hoid[13]


### Yolen
Even prior to the [[Shattering\|Shattering]], dragons were much more cosmere-aware than humans and [[Sho Del\|Sho Del]], and a few may have gone off-world before anyone else did. On [[Yolen\|Yolen]], dragons were worshipped as deities and considered themselves divine in turn, with believers praying to them through Tamu Keks. [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]], however, was not a dragon.
Two dragons are known to have been involved in the Shattering of Adonalsium, with one being [[Koravellium Avast\|Koravellium Avast]], who would go on to take up the [[Shard\|Shard]] of [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]]. The other one, [[Frost\|Frost]], would remain on Yolen after the Shattering, assuming a stance of non-intervention, although he would amass a significant knowledge of the wider cosmere through his relations with both the [[Seventeenth Shard\|Seventeenth Shard]] and [[Hoid\|Hoid]].

### Direct Influences
The [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]]-located city of [[Silverlight\|Silverlight]] was originally built as a collection of dragon palaces. Even in the present day, as the city grew to house worldhoppers of other species, dragons retain a substantial presence in the city, owning corporations, vast establishments and even entire skyscrapers. However, even dragons who would consider Silverlight their home base occassionally depart for a long time. One such dragon is [[Xisisrefliel\|Xisisrefliel]], who for centuries has been living underneath the [[Crimson Sea\|Crimson Sea]] on [[Lumar\|Lumar]] in order to research the breakdown of aethers and aether spores.
When dragons do settle, they will often grant boons to the locals. Xisis receives gifts of human slaves in exchange for various boons both material, such as advanced off-world technology, and more insubstantial, like information or medical treatment. Over on [[Roshar\|Roshar]], Koravellium Avast grants her own boons to various petitioners, though rather than taking anything in exchange, she grants a matching curse. Whether this is her own choice or a compulsion is unclear.

### Cultural Influences
>“*Like a grandmother tucking away that bit of string that wrapped her package, the dragons want to know they have a certain number of easily influenced cultures around, for the proverbial rainy day.*”
\-Hoid[13]


Dragons frequently reveal themselves to developing human cultures, so as to plant the seeds for later use; the term "dragon" is known to nigh-on every cosmere culture. The effectiveness of this approach varies, however. On [[Roshar\|Roshar]], despite the world being home to the sole draconic Shard, dragons are virtually unknown in the present times, although ancient artwork depicting draconic creatures suggests this was not always the case. On [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]], on the other hand, dragons are well-known mythological creatures, with the phrase "dragon's nest" referring to someplace highly dangerous. Similarly, dragons are a familiar concept on [[Lumar\|Lumar]], though it's unclear how well-known they were before Xisis moved there.
The planet of [[Komashi\|Komashi]] appears to be particularly taken with dragons. They were popular in the times of the [[Torio\|Torio]] kingdom, with sculptures depicting them frequently used as decorations. Centuries later, in [[Nagadan\|Nagadan]], dragons remained a popular motif, with plush dragons being sold as childrens' toys, and one of the years of the Nagadan calendar being named the year of the dragon. Despite this, Komashi myths seem to paint at least some dragons as antagonistic, as they have stories of dragon-slaying heroes.
In many cultures, dragons are thought to hoard material wealth, which [[Hoid\|Hoid]] theorizes is due to the ridges of dragonsteel that cover their bodies.

## Trivia
Though still present in the cosmere in background roles, dragons are not slated to become major players until the [[Dragonsteel (series)\|Dragonsteel series]].
Brandon likes dragons a lot; they are also the only classical fantasy race to feature in the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]]. However, the early books in the cosmere were published at the time where "dragon books", such as ** and ** were extremely popular. As such, Brandon felt that the market was "dragon flooded" and postponed involving dragons in his stories until much later.
[[Hoid\|Hoid]] has dated a dragon at some point.
[[Nomad\|Nomad]], disappointed that the [[Greater Good\|Greater Good]] were just a group of old women, muses that one of them could theoretically secretly be a dragon which he would find much more exciting.
