## Allomantic Use
A chromium [[Misting\|Misting]] is known as a **Leecher**. Chromium acts just like [[Aluminum\|aluminum]] inside the body, causing any [[Allomancer\|Allomancers]] touched by a Leecher to lose their metal reserves. When burning away a person's metals, it feels like pulling power from the metal and returning it to an external source. Being leeched makes one feel a sudden coldness.
This power is similar to [[Nightblood\|Nightblood]] and [[Larkin\|larkin]]. When burning away a person's metals, non-[[Investiture\|Invested]] metals go before the Invested ones. Only Allomantically relevant metals can be burned away.

### Draining Investiture
A Leecher can also drain other forms of Investiture. They would be fairly effective at draining a person's [[Breath\|Breath]] or [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]]. They could also Leech a [[Feruchemist\|Feruchemist]] who was tapping their metalmind. They would be able to Leech from a [[Lifeless\|Lifeless]]. A Leecher could prevent a [[Shardbearer\|Shardbearer]] from summoning their blade, and can prevent a weapon using Investiture from working. If a Leecher touched [[Nightblood\|Nightblood]], the Leecher would die.

## Feruchemical Use
A chromium [[Ferring\|Ferring]] is known as a **Spinner**. Chromium is used to store [[Fortune\|Fortune]]. A Spinner filling a chromiummind will be unlucky, and can tap it to increase their luck.

### Compounding
A chromium [[Compounding\|Compounder]] might be able to use chromium to have a nearly infinite supply of fortune and luck; however, the mechanics of Fortune are unknown at this time.

## Hemalurgic Use
When used as a Hemalurgic spike, chromium might steal destiny.

## Other Uses
[[Alonoe\|Alonoe]] of the [[Ire\|Ire]] mentions that drawing on Fortune can cause coincidences to happen. [[Odium\|Odium]] implies it may be used to predict the future.
