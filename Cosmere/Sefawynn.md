**Sefawynn** is a [[Weswaran\|Weswaran]] [[Skop\|skop]].

## Appearance and Personality
Sefawynn bears the Night Marks, a birthmark of three dark blue spots which is seen as a sign of being chosen or cursed by Woden.
Sefawynn doubts her own abilities as a skop; while she can see [[Wight\|wights]] invisible to other people, her boasts do not seem to take effect, so she considers herself essentially a grifter.

## History
Sefawynn met [[John West\|John West]] when she and her brother captured John shortly after his arrival. She decided he must be a charlatan rather than an aelv, despite his appearance. She comes to respect him as they travel together, attempting to rescue her brother [[Wyrm\|Wyrm]].
As they continued to travel together, Sefawynn and John fell in love. When the [[Hordamen\|Hordamen]] launched a major invasion of [[Maelport\|Maelport]], she defied [[Woden\|Woden]] and her boasts inspired the wights to attack the Hordamen. After the battle, [[Logna\|Logna]] told John that his other-dimensional nature would protect Sefawynn from Woden's retaliation, and they eventually married.
