**Nanites** are minuscule machines that augment human bodies by providing different healthcare, structural reinforcement, and other functions.
They can sacrifice themselves to close wounds, and self-replicate back to normal levels. This process takes time and carbon. They can also be transferred to another person to heal them, though they won't let the donor's nanite levels drop below 5%.
