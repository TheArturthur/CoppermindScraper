**Father Bin** is a [[Survivorism\|Survivorist]] priest from [[Elendel\|Elendel]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
After [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]] and [[Steris Harms\|Steris Harms]] agreed to marry, Wax sent a formal request to Father Bin asking him to perform the ceremony. Later that year, prior to the mistdawn sermon, the rogue [[Kandra\|kandra]] [[Paalm\|Paalm]] disguised herself as a [[Pathian\|Pathian]] priest named [[Larskpur\|Larskpur]]. She nailed the still living Father Bin through his eyes to the wall in the chapel and then covered him over with a draping. After people arrived for the service, Paalm started ranting, telling the Survivorists that [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] was a false god who had cared only about himself, before revealing Father Bin's corpse. By doing so, Paalm exacerbated tensions between Survivorists and Pathians, pushing [[Elendel\|Elendel]] further toward rioting. Waxillium later discovered both Larskpur's bones and a bloody mallet, which he presumed had been used to kill Father Bin, in the back of [[Chapaou\|Chapaou's]] coach.
