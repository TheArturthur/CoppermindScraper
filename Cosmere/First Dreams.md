## Personnel
The ship is captained by [[Vazrmeb\|Vazrmeb]] and helmed by [[Droz\|Droz]]. Vazrmeb hires a [[Soulcaster\|Soulcaster]] named [[Kaza\|Kaza]] to accompany them on the trip. The rest of the crew is made up of sailors hired in [[Steen\|Steen]]. The cook is [[Reshi\|Reshi]] in appearance. It is not clear if the ship is owned by Vazrmeb or if it was chartered.
Vazrmeb and Droz both seek [[Gemheart\|gemhearts]] that they believe to be on the island. Kaza hopes to find a cure to her Soulcasting [[Savant\|savanthood]] that is slowly killing her.

## History
### Voyage to Akinah
After the [[Scouring of Aimia\|scouring of Aimia]], few people tried to approach Akinah due to exceptionally dangerous conditions in the area; the [[Sleepless\|Sleepless]] also warned mankind against any attempts to travel there. However, Vazrmeb and Droz were determined to become rich by retrieving gemhearts that they believed to be on the island. Vazrmeb somehow knew a few things about the perils of approaching Akinah, since he was aware that a Soulcaster would be needed to breach a wall of stone spikes that encircled the island.
The ship departed from [[Liafor\|Liafor]] on the mainland and sailed north along the coast of [[Shinovar\|Shinovar]]. It then crossed the [[Aimian Sea\|Aimian Sea]], passing through an intense, unusual storm. Upon approaching Akinah, the crew boarded the ship's dinghies and Kaza was able to Soulcast holes in the spikes surrounding the island. The crew suddenly started to drop dead, but Kaza managed to reach the shore. She saw a [[Larkin\|larkin]] and the remains of a [[Lanceryn\|lanceryn]], including its gemheart. The cook revealed that she was Sleepless and that she had poisoned the crew in order to protect a secret on the island. Kaza Soulcasted herself into smoke before succumbing to the poison. The ship was sabotaged and left to sink by one of the Sleepless obedient to [[Yelamaiszin\|Yelamaiszin]].

### Recovery
Despite being sabotaged, *First Dreams* did not sink. Instead, it drifted in the open sea for about five months until it was discovered by a military scout ship captained by [[Smta\|Smta]]. Yelamaiszin believed that [[Arclomedarian\|Arclomedarian]] may have been responsible for the ship's unusual survival, but [[Rysn Ftori\|Rysn]] thought that the person who tried to scuttle it simply wasn't aware of how hard it is to sink modern [[Thaylen\|Thaylen]] ships.
The ship's sails were in tatters and it was listing to port. [[Yalb\|Yalb]] and some other sailors from Smta's crew inspected the ship and found no crew or ship's log. They did find the name of the ship; the first mate recognized it as the rumored "ghost ship" that had disappeared during a mysterious voyage. Smta was aware of Yalb's unusual history as a survivor of the *[[Wind's Pleasure\|Wind's Pleasure]]*, and after *First Dreams* was affixed with an extra sail, she tasked him with sailing the vessel back to port in [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]] to undergo repairs so it could possibly be redeployed.
Queen [[Navani Kholin\|Navani Kholin]] learned of the ship's recovery and took a keen interest in learning more about Akinah, as she was aware there had been an [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] in Aimia. She sent out a request for another ship to sail to Akinah to find out more about the island, the strange storm surrounding it, and the fate of the *First Dreams*. Despite a reward being offered, weeks passed with no takers. About two months after the *First Dreams* was recovered, Rysn decided to tour the ship to help her determine whether to take Navani's offer, and did not find anything odd - there was no blood on the decks, and no sign of the Soulcaster that was thought to be on board. She ultimately chose to lead the *[[Wandersail (1174 ship)\|Wandersail]]* on an [[Expedition to Akinah\|expedition to Akinah]].
