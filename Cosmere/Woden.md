## Personality
[[Sefawynn\|Sefawynn]] says that Woden demands sacrifice, and [[Ealstan\|Ealstan]] says he rewards blood offerings, but Logna says that this is wrong and Woden only ever cared about victory. According to Logna, Woden hates losing and fears pain and the thought that he will someday die.
Ealstan says that Woden does not care about being worshipped so long as he is obeyed and feared.

## History
In response to Friag's death at the [[Battle of Badon\|battle of Badon]],Woden forbade humans to use writing (which had been Friag's invention).
By the time John West arrives, Woden has abandoned the Weswarans in favor of the Hordamen. Ultimately, Woden inspires a major invasion of Hordamen intended to destroy the Weswarans in order to eliminate the "outsiders" from another dimension and to serve as an example to intimidate his other worshippers. When that invasion is defeated, Weswarans begin to see Woden as an enemy god.

## Trivia
