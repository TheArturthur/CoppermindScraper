## Era 2: Wax and Wayne Series
Set about 300 years after Era 1, the Wax and Wayne series is about the exploits of [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]], a "wild-west Deputy" forced to move into the big city who starts investigating kidnappings and robberies.

*The Alloy of Law* was initially conceived as one of several short stories Brandon wanted to set between the first and second main trilogies that eventually grew into a full novel, and then a series. The Wax and Wayne series is a single four book series; *The Alloy of Law* stands more-or-less alone while the rest are plotted together like a trilogy.
Brandon has also said that he may do some more stories before the second trilogy, set in a 1940's society.

## Era 3: Ghostbloods Trilogy
**Mistborn: Ghostbloods**, the third trilogy, will be set in the early computer age with 1980s technology. The main character is planned as a Terris woman who is a computer programmer and [[Nicrosil\|Nicroburst]]; her brother is also planned to be a character. Peter has described her as a "brown Terris geek girl", though he does point out that this could change by the time the series is actually being written. Brandon backs up this description, and describes it as a sort of "how nerd culture works on Scadrial." Brandon had initially planned for the trilogy to feature an Allomancer SWAT team, with a team of allomancers hired to take out a serial killer, but is now leaning more towards a spy thriller. It will probably be released in the 2020s, after *Stormlight 5* and the *Elantris* sequels.
He will be writing it in a similar manner to the first trilogy, writing all three books before publishing so that he could properly foreshadow and edit past books. He is greatly looking forward to writing book ten. These will be returning to the length of the Mistborn Era One books.
It is planned for these books to include a global map of Scadrial. There are short comic books that are planned to be interspersed in them, similar to the broadsheets in Era Two. There are going to be allomancy-involved sports, and various characters are planned to be [[Twinborn\|Twinborn]] with "really neat combinations." It is planned to take place fifty to seventy years after Era Two, by which time the [[Southern Scadrian\|Southern Scadrians]] will be well-known to the rest of Scadrial. It will put more focus upon [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] and [[Trell (Trellism)\| Trell]]. [[MeLaan\|MeLaan]] is also expected to play a role.

## Possible Cyberpunk Mistborn Trilogy
Brandon has interest in writing a "Cyberpunk" Mistborn trilogy between Eras Three and Four. Whether he writes it depends on how Era Three plays out and if he feels he has enough time to write more books before he gets too old. The books would be similar in length to Era Two (around 100,000 words) and be written around the same time as the second half of the Stormlight Archive. This trilogy would become Era Four and push space age Mistborn to Era Five and put Mistborn up to a fitting sixteen books. If a whole trilogy isn’t feasible he wants to at least write a novella. Nothing about the characters or plot are known but Brandon wants to play with unsealed metalminds as cyberpunk-esque “metallurgic wetware”.


## Era 4: Fourth Mistborn Trilogy
The fourth trilogy is going to be a space-opera with [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]]-powered faster-than-light technology. [[Hoid\|Hoid]] will be a main character in this trilogy. The [[Sleepless\|Sleepless]], or Dysian Aimians, will also have a major role in this trilogy. The Iriali are also planned to have a major role.
There may be two more currently untitled cosmere series written before this trilogy.
He plans for each Era 4 book to be around the length of a Stormlight book.
