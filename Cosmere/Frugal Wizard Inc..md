## History
Interdimensional travel was first discovered in 2084, with [[Cecil G. Bagsworth III\|Cecil G. Bagsworth III]] as an early participant. Eventually, the technology was deregulated, which resulted in a new industry of dimensional tourism. Frugal Wizard Inc. obtained a band of medieval-type dimensions and began selling dimensions from that band to interested customers. Bagsworth wrote various customer-facing resources used by Frugal Wizard Inc., including *The Frugal Wizard's Handbook for Surviving Medieval England*.
