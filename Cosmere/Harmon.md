\-Harmon on Hrud's theory about Kelsier[1]

Harmon and the rest of [[Camon\|Camon's]] group, then reporting to [[Milev\|Milev]], told the story of the Survivor of Hathsin to [[Vin\|Vin]] just before [[Kelsier's crew\|Kelsier's crew]] arrived at their safe house. Harmon dismissed [[Hrud\|Hrud's]] notion that [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] was something other than a man but posited that he was a [[Allomancy\|mistborn]]. He and Milev's crew left, leaving Vin behind to attend the meeting with Kelsier's crew.
