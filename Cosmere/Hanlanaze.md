**Professor Hanlanaze** is a well known mathematician and scientist from [[New Seran\|New Seran]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
He presumably speaks with a **[[Thermolian\|Thermolian]]** accent (with distinctive "v" sounds) common in the remote southern village where he grew up. He has a beard, is fairly heavyset, and is at least part [[Terris\|Terris]].
He is known for contributing to several new discoveries related to combustion technology. He maintains correspondence with other scientists, including [[Rame Maldor\|Rame Maldor]], and is familiar with recent research in the field of electromagnetism. [[Sophi Tarcsel\|Sophi Tarcsel]] claims that Hanlanaze stole [[Remmingtel Tarcsel\|her father's]] research on incandescent lights and falsely took credit for the designs that gained widespread use.
In 342 [[Catacendre\|PC]], he was invited to the governor's spring dinner and policy speech at [[Lady ZoBell\|Lady ZoBell's]] penthouse in [[Elendel\|Elendel]], but was a known recluse and replied that he might not make it to the party. Despite a note on the name manifest not to let anyone else in using his ticket, [[Wayne\|Wayne]] successfully impersonated him to sneak into the party.
