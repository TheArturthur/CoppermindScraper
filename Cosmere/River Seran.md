The **River Seran** is a river at the edge of the [[Eastern Dominance\|Eastern Dominance]] of the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]]. It connects the two Serans, [[North Seran\|North Seran]] and [[South Seran\|South Seran]], and is near the [[Conventical of Seran\|Conventical of Seran]]. It is unclear if the lakes were named Seran first, or the Conventical, or some other city.
There is at least one settlement or plantation on the River Seran.
