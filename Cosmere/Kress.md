**Kress** is a planet in the Empire of [[Firstborn\|Firstborn]]. It is a sparsely inhabited world, near the border of the Empire's Reaches. It is a brightly colored planet, with unregulated weather and strong winds. The grass on Kress is at least high enough to reach a persons knees, and the sun is somewhat intense in its brightness.

A meeting between [[Varion Crestmar\|Varion Crestmar]] and the imperial navy was staged there.
