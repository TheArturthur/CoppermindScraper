## Geography
### Territories and Features
#### Territories
Makabakam lies in the southwest and middle of [[Roshar\|Roshar]], stretching across a large valley, later known as Makabak. Makabak is surrounded by the [[Mountains of Ur\|mountains of Ur]], and it claims them as it’s territory. To the east, it borders [[Valhav\|Valhav]] while to the north and north-west, it shares a border with the Silver kingdom of [[Sela Tales\|Sela Tales]]. Additionally, Makabakam’s west sees sees a short border with [[Shin Kak Nish\|Shin Kak Nish]].
Besides the mainland, the Makabaki people governed a number of territories off the coast. Almost all of these are located on the [[Southern Depths\|Southern Depths]], where a small island chain is under Makabaki control. The Makabaki also govern a large island near the [[Tarat Sea\|Tarat Sea]]. [[Aimia\|Aimia]] also owns islands close to these islands, and therefore it could be said that they border as well. Makabakam also contains the [[Valley\|Valley]], and the lands surrounding Urithiru.

#### Geographic Features
Makabak has numerous rivers running through it, the largest ones run south, ending in the [[Southern Depths\|Southern Depths]]. Makabak also contains a body of water known as the ‘grand waterway’, as well as a large bay separating the now Tukari peninsula from the rest of Makabakam. Like stated earlier, Makabakam is surrounded by the mountains of Ur.

## Culture
#### Ethnicity and People
The people of Makabakam are called Makabaki. The Makabaki are short and usually have dark skin — deep brown, but not true black like some [[Parshmen\|parshmen]]. They also have epicanthic folds. Some Makabaki belong to the [[Askarki\|Askarki]] ‘tribe’, namely those living in the southeast in what would later become [[Emul\|Emul]] Among the Heralds, [[Shalash\|Shalash]] looks like an Makabaki woman.

## History
### Creation of Roshar
The land that would become known as Makabakam was created at an unknown point before the [[Shattering\|Shattering]] by [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]], along with the rest of Roshar and the Rosharan supercontinent over ten-thousand years prior to Vorin year 1174. It is unclear how much the geography of Makabakam has changed compared to the land at creation.

### Pre-Human Arrival
Before humanity arrived on Roshar from Ashyn, the land that would come to be known as Makabakam was inhabited by [[Singers\|Singers]].
Circa -5825 in the Vorin calendar, humanity arrived on Roshar after fleeing Ashyn and were granted the land that would become [[Shin Kak Nish\|Shin Kak Nish]]. After less than a generation, they headed an invasion, slaughtering some of the Singers and expelling them from their land, claiming it as their own, this included the land that would come to be known as Makabakam. This history was lost to man until the discovery of the [[Eila Stele\|Eila Stele]].

### The Establishment of Makabakam
  Map of the Silver Kingdoms
 was founded in the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]] Epoch. Due to the Desolations, the Makabaki were constantly returned back to early technological levels, often to the point of having to make use of stone tools. Though they advanced each time with the help of the Heralds whenever they returned, often receiving this assistance from [[Kalak\|Kalak]] and his [[Willshapers\|Willshapers]]. Old manuscripts and texts dating back to these times mention quick-spreading diseases in the east that killed tens of thousands, and it is likely that at least some of these diseases spread to Makabakam.
Very early in the nation's history, the city of [[Azimir\|Azimir]] was created and made into its capital. Azimir was eventually made into the home of the Makabaki Oathgate. Despite the wish by many that Urithiru be built in Alethela, for a reason obvious to many others at the time, it could not be, instead being built in the mountains of Ur, inside ’s borders.
Makabakam went to war with Alethela because of a dispute concerning trade routes, the full effects this had on both kingdoms are unknown.

#### Further Desolations
The Sixth Epoch lasted at least thirty-one years, and likely significantly longer, before its Desolation arrived.
One of the many Desolations that struck the nation, along with the rest of Roshar, arrived in the year 337 of the Eighth Epoch. This Desolation was heralded by the release of [[Midnight Essence\|Midnight Essence]] in a small settlement in [[Natanatan\|Natanatan]]. The length of this Desolation is unknown.
Another Desolation occurred later and ended circa -3333, during an unknown Epoch. This left society wounded and weak, forcing them into a period of recovery.

#### The Last Desolation (c.-3332)
The Last Desolation was a large scale Desolation which occurred circa -3332, around 4500 years before the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]]. This Desolation was particularly devasting due to the fact that it happened only a year after the previous Desolation, and thus society was weakened and still recovering. Tired of the Desolations and their torture on Braize, the nine Heralds still on Roshar refused to return to Braize, leaving Taln as the sole Herald on the planet for millennia.
After the Last Desolation, Desolations ceased to ravage the nation. Due to this, society was able to advance much further than ever before, giving them the strength to potentially resist any potential Desolation without complete societal collapse. The era heralded by the Last Desolation came to be known as the Era of Solitude.

#### After Aharietiam
At some unknown point in history, after Aharietiam, Makabakam collapsed. 4500 years after the Last Desolation, the area that was Makabakam had fractured into a dozen kingdoms. These kingdoms still had many shared cultural aspects though, and the area in which they lay was called Makabak, after the silver kingdom.
