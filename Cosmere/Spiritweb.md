The **spiritweb** is the network of [[Connection\|Connections]] and [[Investiture\|Investiture]] which make up the soul of a creature, place, or object. Residing in the [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual Realm]], spiritwebs lack any tangible shape or size, with their borders defined by their [[Identity\|Identity]]. Contained within a spiritweb are various pieces, including **Spiritual DNA**, the **Spiritual Aspect**, and one’s **Spiritual Ideal**.

## Mechanics
### Spiritual DNA
A person’s spiritweb, closely related to Spiritual DNA, makes up their presence in the Spiritual Realm. Measuring and quantifying a spiritweb is possible, if difficult, to do. Spiritual DNA can be passed from parent to child like regular DNA, yet does not function exactly the same as identical twins can have different Spiritual DNA. Some ways of utilizing Investiture are written into Spiritual DNA. Spiritwebs can be manufactured, though the process of how is unknown.

### Damaging and Healing
A person's spiritweb can be damaged either through physical or emotional trauma. This creates "cracks" in the soul. It is easier for Shards to [[Invest\|Invest]] in people who are damaged in this way, as Investiture can enter the soul through these "cracks". This is why [[Allomancer\|Allomancers]] need to undergo [[Snapping\|Snapping]] in order to awaken their powers, and is implied to be the reason why [[Surgebinder\|Surgebinders]] tend to have psychological problems. Spiritwebs can be damaged with weapons like hemalurgic spikes and Shardblades. Those wounds can then be healed with a graft of Investiture. The healing process does leave a permanent wound on a person's spiritweb. Investing an object or person for a long period of time will warp and change their spiritweb. In humans, this process leads to [[Savant\|Savantism]].

#### Healing the Physical
Most forms of healing work by using the three aspects of the user's self; their Physical, Cognitive, and Spiritual. Healing typically heals the Physical version by matching it to their Spiritual Ideal, which is filtered through the lens of their minds (the Cognitive aspect). Almost all forms of healing in the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]], even natural healing, are filtered through the perception of the user,  which means that if a person hasn't accepted a wound as a part of themselves, they can still heal it regardless of how long they've had it. However, even if a wound is recent, if the person has changed their mindset to see it as a part of themselves, they will not be able to heal from it. An example of this can be found when [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] was unable to heal his slave brand until he swore the fourth oath and recognized that it wasn't a part of him.

## Interactions
All forms of Investiture which one can use are related to the spiritweb. Some manifestations of Investiture are built into a person's Spiritual DNA, such as [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]] and [[Feruchemy\|Feruchemy]]. Other abilities, such as [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgy]] and [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]], involve manipulating Spiritual DNA. A few types of Investiture even work by manipulating or overwriting the spiritweb directly, such as [[Forgery\|Forgery]].

### Awakening
The ability to give [[Breath\|Breath]], which is a part of a person's Spiritual aspect, is built into a [[Nalthis\|Nalthian's]] Spiritual DNA. The ability to [[Awakening\|Awaken]] is not limited to Nalthians.

### The Dor
#### AonDor
[[AonDor\|AonDor]] requires some innate Spiritual DNA, but the [[Shaod\|Shaod]] that turns someone into an [[Elantrian\|Elantrian]] involves some sort of change to the Spiritual DNA during the transition.

#### Forgery
[[Forgery\|Forgery]] works by overlaying an object’s or person’s history and spiritweb with an alternative one. This may indicate that it is possible to remove the effects of a [[Soulstamp\|soulstamp]], though it is currently unknown.

### Heat Sharing
People from the planet [[Canticle\|Canticle]] are able to exchange portions of their spirtweb similar to breath. Unlike breath, heat can only be exchanged with people of Canticle (including by invitation). It is unclear how this would interact with Allomancy, as the strength of Allomantic power is generally proportional to the amount of [[Preservation\|Preservation's]] investiture an Allomancer contains.

### The Metallic Arts
#### Allomancy
Multiple forms of Allomancy relate to the spiritweb. Allomantic [[Zinc\|zinc]] and [[Brass\|brass]] will work only on creatures with a sufficient level of sapience and work better on creatures whose spiritweb has been damaged, as with Hemalurgic constructs. The ability to use Allomancy is passed down via Spiritual DNA.

#### Feruchemy
Several of the Feruchemical Attributes are deeply connected to the spiritweb, especially the Spiritual metals such as [[Aluminum\|aluminum]] and [[Duralumin\|duralumin]], which allow for Identity and Connection, respectively, to be stored. Similarly to Allomancy, the ability to use Feruchemy is passed down through Spiritual DNA.

#### Hemalurgy
In Hemalurgy, portions of the spiritweb seem to be ripped off of one person and grafted onto another person's spiritweb. This causes lasting damage to the spiritweb of the creature in which a Hemalurgic Spike is placed.

### Surgebinding
A [[Surgebinder\|Surgebinder's]] [[Nahel bond\|Nahel bond]] involves a [[Spren\|spren]] attaching themselves to a person's spiritweb, merging more fully as the [[Surgebinder\|Surgebinder]] progresses in their [[Immortal Words\|Oaths]].

#### Bondsmithing
A [[Bondsmith\|Bondsmith]] that is bonded to the [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]] is able to read a person's spiritweb. The person's spiritweb appears to the Bondsmith as faintly glowing lines of varying thickness. It is currently unknown if others share this ability.

#### Soulcasting
Although it does not directly alter the spiritweb, [[Soulcasting\|Soulcasting]] can alter a spiritweb if the Cognitive aspect stays altered for long enough.

#### Regrowth
[[Regrowth\|Regrowth]] allows for healing both the Physical form of a living thing and its spiritweb, as does a sufficient amount of Stormlight. This likely functions by restoring one’s physical form to the state of their Spiritual Ideal. Regrowth can even go so far as to reattach the soul of one recently deceased.

### Shardblades
A [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] can be stolen with Hemalurgy, because it is Connected to a person's spiritweb. When a Shardblade cuts through living matter, its edge fuzzes, leaving the physical body uninjured, whilst cutting the being's Cognitive self - not their spiritweb.

### Fabrials
There are fabrials, that are capable of accurately [[Aura fabrial\|reading a person's spiritweb]]. However, these devices tend to go haywire if the person being read is heavily Invested, such as a [[Returned\|Returned]], [[Elantrian\|Elantrian]], or [[Yoki-hijo\|yoki-hijo]].
