>“*Don’t draw attention to yourself. Don’t set yourself above others. He who makes himself high will be cast low.*”
\-Vivenna quoting one of the five Visions[1]


The **five Visions** are part of the doctrine of [[Austrism\|Austrism]], a religion primarily practiced in [[Idris\|Idris]] on [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]]. They are guidelines spoken by the first [[Returned\|Returned]], [[Vo\|Vo]], as a message from the god Austre.

## Tenets
The Visions teach the believers of Austre to be patient, humble, sacrificing, selfless, and understanding. Followers should not be ostentatious, haughty, selfish, or place themselves above others.

## History
>“*I saw men who placed themselves above others, and I saw them cast down.*”
\-Vivenna quoting one of the five Visions[9]


[[Vo\|Vo]], the first Returned, was born aboard a ship sailing to the coast. He declared the five Visions and died the next week, according to [[Hoid\|Hoid]].
To set an example in following the five Visions, every noble or rich Idrian family was obligated by tradition to provide one person to the monasteries. Vivenna decided to become a monk at a young age, and was able to quote several of the Visions from memory as an adult. Conversely, [[Siri\|Siri]] had difficulty even naming all five of the Visions.
Vivenna later realized that many followers of Austrism took the idea of humility from the five Visions too far, causing them to wrongly condemn [[Awakening\|Awakening]].
