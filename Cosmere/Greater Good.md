The **Greater Good** is the ruling council of [[Beacon\|Beacon]] on [[Canticle\|Canticle]]. The group comprises three members who are appointed gerontocratically in the months before they are converted into [[Sunheart\|sunhearts]]. Each member is given a title which becomes the member's de facto name and a specific duty or calling that they are to represent within the council.
The Greater Good acts as a decision-making body for the city of Beacon but can delegate authority to other people or positions such as appointing a [[Lodestar\|Lodestar]] or putting a difficult decision to a vote of the whole population. Due to the short tenures and ever changing membership of the Greater Good, a steward or city administrator serves under the greater good to provide continuity of leadership. Also under their leadership are a field commander or special ops planner and a lead engineer. The Greater Good also has the power to discipline specific members of the community for disobeying their directives.
The Greater Good wear common black dresses, gloves, and and hats even while indoors. When disagreeing or offering a countervailing opinion to another member, the Greater Good speak formally and deferentially.

## History
In the years leading up to the fall of the [[Cinder King\|Cinder King]], [[Compassion\|Compassion]], [[Confidence\|Confidence]], and [[Contemplation\|Contemplation]] are named to the Greater Good and vote to name [[Elegy Salvage\|Elegy Salvage]] as Beacon's new Lodestar. Following Elegy's plan, a decision is made to end the practice of converting people into sun sunhearts and instead to search for the mythical [[Refuge of Stone\|Refuge of Stone]]. Following Elegy's capture and conversion into a [[Charred\|Charred]], the Greater Good decides to continue with the plan to find the Refuge, ultimately at the expense of most of the ships comprising Beacon and several Beaconite lives. After the Cinder King's fall, the Greater Good attempts to cede power to [[Rebeke Salvage\|Rebeke Salvage]] but ultimately retain their authority.

## Relationships
### Elegy
The Greater Good votes to name Elegy as Beacon's new Lodestar. As Lodestar, Elegy's main purpose is to be Beacon's chief navigator but she is also a leader in charge of the long term vision of the city. Following Elegy's plan and ending the practice of converting people into sunhearts has allowed the members of the Greater Good to live and rule for longer than they otherwise would have, a fact that at least Contemplation feels guilty about.
