## Appearence
The warship is very large. The hull of the ship is made from a dark wood type. It’s corridors are round, looking like tubes. The ship also has electric lights.
The ship has a docking bay of sorts, where skimmers can dock and people can enter the ship. This bay seems to have doors that can open to the outside. There are also several skimmers onboard, these skimmers look a little like open topped fishing boats.
As all other airships we have seen have them, it is likely that the ship has large pontoons, which have fans attached to it. These fans are powered by [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]], keeping the ship afloat. This is possible due to the reduced weight of the ship, which works because of [[Iron\|Iron]] [[Feruchemy\|Feruchemy]].

## Usage
It is a warship, meaning that it is likely employed in war. The ship generally flies very high up in the sky, with even it’s low altitude being higher then a [[Allomancy\|Coinshot]] can reach.

## History
It is unknown when Daal’s warship was constructed. At some point, either directly after its construction or a while after it, the ship became Admiral [[Daal\|Daal]]’s personal ship. As Daal’s personal ship it likely went on a number of campaigns.
In the year 348 PC Daal was appointed ambassador of the [[Malwish Consortium\|Malwish Consortium]]. He took the ship with him to the [[Elendel Basin\|Elendel Basin]] and met [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]] on it. As he resided in [[Elendel\|Elendel]] the ship would stay here as well. Eventually the ship would leave Elendel and carry Daal, along with some Elendel officials, to safety.
