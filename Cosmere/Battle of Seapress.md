The **battle of Seapress** was a conflict between the [[High Empire\|High Empire]] and the people of [[Seapress\|Seapress]]. It was [[Varion Crestmar\|Varion Crestmar's]] first battle and the start of the [[Reunification War\|Reunification War]]. Using far inferior ships, he managed to convince the enemy he intended to surrender and join them when first approaching, then suddenly turned on them. He did this by invoking a rarely used article of the law that let him take over the ship he was on. This battle was later used multiple times as a simulation for [[Dennison Crestmar\|Dennison Crestmar]] to fight.
