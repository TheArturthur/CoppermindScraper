**Dirge** is a resident of [[Beacon\|Beacon]] on [[Canticle\|Canticle]]. He is a member of a team of five engineers led by [[Solemnity Divine\|Solemnity Divine]]. [[Nomad\|Nomad]] considers the engineering team to be "overachievers" that are quite knowledgeable and skilled. However, Canticle's brutal environment and lack of [[Cosmere\|cosmere]] awareness does not afford them the opportunity to study certain concepts that would be considered elementary on some other planets.
Dirge participated in testing the prototypes of Nomad's steam-powered engine and helped refine the design.
