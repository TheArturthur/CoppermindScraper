## Appearance and Personality
Conrad is a brave red-haired man. The exhausted man had ash-stained clothing and wore the leathers of a scout when he reached Elend.
He personally knows General [[Demoux\|Demoux]].

## History
When [[Elend\|Elend]] set out with his army to secure the [[Storage cavern\|storage caverns]] in several cities, [[Demoux\|Demoux]] left Lieutenant Conrad behind in [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]] to serve King [[Penrod\|Penrod]].
As the [[Deepness\|Deepness]] grew, hunger and riots became more common in Luthadel. Penrod sent Conrad and three other soldiers separately to ask Elend, who was [[Siege of Fadrex City\|besieging Fadrex City]], for more troops to restore order in the capital.
Conrad was the only messenger who reached Elend. On his way there, he was chased by a group of [[Koloss\|koloss]]. He managed to escape them by using his horse as bait and distraction.

>“*I don't know why. I can only relay the message I was sent to deliver.*”
\-Conrad explaining why King Penrod needed more troops in Luthadel.[1]

Upon reaching Elend's army nearby [[Fadrex City\|Fadrex City]], [[Ham\|Ham]] led him to Elend. After he delivered his message, Conrad startled at Elend's initial outburst of anger because Penrod didn't have the situation under control in Luthadel. Later that evening, after Conrad had gotten some rest, he and Elend spoke again in depth.
After Demoux's brawl with [[Bilg\|Bilg]], Elend agreed to send about three hundred men back with Conrad, the exact number of [[Mistfallen\|mistfallen]] who were seen as cursed by most of the army. They traveled back to Luthadel by canal.

## Trivia
