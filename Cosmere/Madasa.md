**Madasa** is a historical figure on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] from a time prior to the [[Day of Recreance\|Day of Recreance]]. They are mentioned in *[[Words of Radiance (in-world)\|Words of Radiance]]* in connection to the [[Order of Bondsmiths\|Order of Bondsmiths]]. It is not clear if Madasa was actually a [[Knight Radiant\|Knight Radiant]] or some other contemporary authority figure.

>“* But as for the [[Bondsmith\|Bondsmiths]], they had members only three, which number was not uncommon for them; nor did they seek to increase this by great bounds, for during the times of Madasa, only one of their order was in continual accompaniment of [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] and its thrones. Their spren was understood to be specific, and to persuade them to grow to the magnitude of the other orders was seen as seditious.*”
