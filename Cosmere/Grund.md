**Grund** is an urchin in [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] during the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]].

## Appearance and Personality
Grund has [[Darkeyes\|dark]] green eyes and a malformed hand. He is typically grimy and is generally accepting of his station in life. He occupies himself by drawing or doing small jobs like recovering hogshide from old shoes.

## History
During the [[Siege of Kholinar\|Siege of Kholinar]], Grund lived with [[Ma\|Ma]] and [[Seland\|Seland]] in an abandoned shop in [[Ringington market\|Ringington market]] that had been damaged by the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]]. He hung around the [[Secure Keeps\|Secure Keeps]], where [[Velalant\|Velalant]] was giving away grain mostly to households of [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]], and attracted the attention of [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]], who was there with [[Elhokar Kholin\|Elhokar Kholin]] as part of his task force to recover the city. Shallan bribed Grund with one of her meat sticks to tell her about the food distribution, but he fled after receiving a second stick. She returned to the market many times after that and met with Grund to get information. Unfortunately, Shallan's attention attracted the attention of the [[Grips\|Grips]] as well, a local gang that took the food from Grund and beat him if he tried to hold back. They instructed Grund to wait around for Shallan and came to collect when she left. While he was initially excited to see Shallan every time she showed up, he became more and more jaded and reserved.
Wanting to attract the attention of the [[Cult of Moments\|Cult of Moments]] by giving away food, Shallan asked Grund for a list of people who were poor and needing food but unable to collect from Velalant's distributions. At his word, she began bringing food to people such as [[Muri\|Muri]], [[Jom\|Jom]], and others. She also asked Grund to look for a copy of [[Hessi\|Hessi's]] *[[Mythica\|Mythica]]*, and he eventually found one for her with the help of the Grips. Eventually the situation between Grund and the Grips became so dangerous that Ma and Seland moved out, leaving Grund alone in the old shop; he lied about their motivation to Shallan, saying that they had left because they thought the condition of the building was getting too dangerous.

>“*My **life** was waiting for you. If I wasn't here when you came, or if I tried to hide the food, they beat me.*”
\-Grund to Shallan[1]

After Shallan's visit to the revel, she took some more food to Grund. Thinking she was the gang, he hid from her at first. He tried to cover up his unease, but Shallan noticed that he was unhappy to see her and seemed too eager to please. Promising that she would be back in a few days with another big haul, Shallan left him only to change her disguise and double back to listen outside the shop. In the meantime, the Grips came to confront Grund. Displeased with the meager amount of food that day, the gang started beating Grund. Shallan witnessed it and shouted at the men angrily; as they scrambled to get away, one of them struck Grund's head with a cudgel and broke his skull. He lived long enough to tell Shallan how much he and all of the other people she had 'blessed' with food handouts hated her because of the position they were in with the Grips. She immediately went to check on Muri, who was about to flee from the gang herself and confirmed Grund's story.
Shallan was guilt-ridden by Grund's death. She huddled, overwhelmed, on the floor in Muri's hovel thinking about Grund and the many others she had failed until [[Wit\|Wit]] arrived and told her that the men in the market had formed a militia and forced the Grips to hand over the man who had murdered Grund.
