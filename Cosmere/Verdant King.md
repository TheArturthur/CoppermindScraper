The **Verdant King** is the king of the [[Emerald Sea\|Emerald Sea]] and possibly other regions. He is referred to solely as the king by the natives of the Emerald Sea, however [[Salay\|Salay]] (from the [[Sapphire Sea\|Sapphire Sea]]) does call him the "Verdant King" indicating this is a recognised title. He resides in a palace on the king's island in the [[Core Archipelago\|Core Archipelago]], presumably [[Kingsport\|Kingsport]]. He is the individual who authorized sending [[Charlie\|Charlie]] to the [[Sorceress\|Sorceress]].
The king is antagonistic toward the Sorceress and the tariffs she imposes on trade through the [[Midnight Sea\|Midnight Sea]], and most of the political actions he is reported to take over the course of the novel are in opposition to her. He sends Charlie to the Sorceress allow the duke's nephew to create an alliance with another kingdom by marriage and commandeers merchant ships into his navy to prepare to fight her.
The king made it law that those living on [[Diggen's Point\|Diggen's Point]] could not leave the island, though he changed this law after [[Tress\|Tress]] and the crew of the *Crow's Song* defeat the [[Sorceress\|Sorceress]] so that residents are allowed to leave but receive a large stipend for working there for twenty years.
A mercantile writ is required from the king to trade goods, though a tariff is imposed still. A king's writs of purchase also forced captains to ferry government officials in need from Diggen's Point.
He supposedly employs five [[King's Mask\|King's Masks]] as assassins to perform important missions.

## Trivia
The only individual to refer to him as the 'Verdant King' is Salay, leaving it unclear if his kingdom solely comprises of the [[Verdant sea\|Verdant sea]] or expands beyond it. It is even possible that his control does not extend to the entire sea as [[Huck\|Huck]] is unsurprised to find an island near the border of the sea did not fly the king's flag.
A [[Regalthon\|regalthon]] (a forty-mile race) is held every year on the king's birthday.
