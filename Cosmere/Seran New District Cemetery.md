The **Seran New District Cemetery** is a cemetery in [[New Seran\|New Seran]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. The city pays the cemetery to take care of unidentified bodies, and it also has the highest frequency of grave robbing among cemeteries in the city. It is run by [[Templeton Fig\|Templeton Fig]].
The cemetery's entrance gates are topped with a statue of the [[Survivor\|Survivor]]. Within is a small caretaker's building with a thatched roof and statues of [[Mistwraith\|mistwraiths]] in its yard. More mistwraith statues are scattered throughout the graveyard, and there is also a statue of the [[Ascendant Warrior\|Ascendant Warrior]] placed in the paupers' section.

## History
When [[ReLuur\|ReLuur]] visited New Seran, an explosion in the city hit him, blowing off a chunk of his body which included one of his spikes. This spike was mixed with the corpses of the people killed in the explosion, which were subsequently buried in a mass grave in the Seran New District Cemetery. Templeton Fig later retrieved the spike from the grave on the orders of the [[Set\|Set]].
Later, [[Wayne\|Wayne]] and [[Marasi\|Marasi]] came to the cemetery looking for the spike and were ambushed by hired killers. After the attack, in which the gravekeeper [[Dechamp\|Dechamp]] was killed, a police [[Allomancer\|Allomancer]] searched for metal in the grave and found none. Wayne and Marasi went back to the gravekeeper's shack and found evidence in a hidden ledger that Templeton knew about the spike and had done something with it.
