## Plot
Through a series of errors and misunderstandings, the hero of the book is accidentally signed up to participate in gladiatorial combat with the current championâ€”a huge barbarian. Over the course of the book, everyone tells the hero that he has no chance of beating the champion, and he tries to find a way out of the battle. However, the hero notices small clues over time and figures out that the champion has a heart problem. In the climactic battle, the hero runs around the outside of the arena until the barbarian dies of a heart attack.

## Development
Brandon has described *Knight Life* as his attempt at a -style adventure comedy that was "mostly cringe, with a little bit of actual comedy". Some of the jokes were almost intentionally unfunny, such as the barbarian wielding a metal carrot instead of a sword. In retrospect, Brandon feels like many of the jokes did not work, although he likes the ending.

## Future
*Knight Life* got shelved as the cosmere began to take shape, and Brandon has not mentioned any serious attempts to revive it. Bits of it got repurposed into the *[[Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians (series)\|Alcatraz]]* series.
It is possible that *Knight Life* could be released in a future [[Dragonsteel Entertainment\|Dragonsteel]] Kickstarter as part of the [[Sanderson Curiosities\|Sanderson Curiosities]] series. However, it is not close to the quality level of other early works like [[The Way of Kings Prime\|The Way of Kings Prime]], and it may be years before Brandon would consider publishing it.
