>“* Each Liveborn received an entire world in which they were the most important person of their time. Some became artists, others politicians, but each had a chance for supreme greatness.*”
\- Kairominas[1]


**Liveborn** are the human inhabitants of the [[State\|States]]. They are each given a State to live in when born and the State is constructed based on their personality, to make their life fulfilling. Given that the States are simulated worlds, the actual physical bodies of the Liveborn are merely brains put in jars filled with a nutrient bath. All of this, including the machinery needed for the simulation, fits in a box the size of a melon.
