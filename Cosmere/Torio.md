## History
It was destroyed by the [[Father machine\|father machine]] one-thousand seven-hundred and sixty-three years before the machine was eventually destroyed. Upon its activation, due to poorly created [[Command\|Commands]], it conflated [[Hijo\|hijo]] and the souls of men, and absorbed both all across the planet, leading to the genocide of all of Torio and the creation of the [[Shroud\|shroud]] that covers all of Komashi. The only survivors were the nomads who lived at the edge of civilization and a few yoki-hijo, who were too heavily Invested to be killed by the machine, and thus were kept in Investiture-based simulations of Torio in localized areas hidden in the shroud, and made to repeat the same day ad infinitum, constantly having their memory of the day erased.

## Culture
They have a culture that deeply values the role of the yoki-hijo, as they provided many important devices required to survive and thrive. They also see them as very important figures in their religion, and deeply revere them.
