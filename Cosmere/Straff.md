## Appearance and Personality
Straff is a manipulative and sadistic monster. He is extremely fond of posturing and demonstrating his superiority, and is terrified of anyone having power over him. He enjoys going to brothels knowing that the skaa will be executed, as it gives him a sense of power.

## Attributes and Abilities
Straff is a very skilled and experienced [[Tin\|tin]] [[Misting\|Misting]] (aka a [[Tineye\|Tineye]]), able to smell even an almost odorless poison in a aromatic tea. He is able to replicate [[Amaranta\|Amaranta's]] drug cocktail based on the smell of the ingredients. Unlike most other Allomancers, Straff doesn’t keep his abilities secret, in order to show off his superiority and fearlessness.

## History
During the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]], Straff is the head of the most powerful of the nobility, [[House Venture\|House Venture]], and controlled the [[Atium\|atium]] mines at the [[Pits of Hathsin\|Pits of Hathsin]] for the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]].
After the fall of the Lord Ruler, he proclaims himself king of the Northern [[Dominance\|Dominance]]. After securing this area, he [[Siege of Luthadel\|lays siege]] to [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]] in order to gain possession of the Lord Ruler's fabled [[Atium cache\|atium cache]].
He invited Elend over to his warcamp for a meeting, and the situation escalates until Straff sends his guards to kill Elend. However, Elend uses [[Vin\|Vin]] to threaten Straff and manipulate Straff's emotions. Straff succumbs to his fear and lets Elend and Vin leave unharmed. After this encounter, Straff becomes terrified of Vin, commanding Zane to kill her.
One of his spurned mistress, [[Amaranta\|Amaranta]], poisoned him with an addictive drug, [[Black Frayn\|Black Frayn]]. Working with Zane, she caused Straff to believe that Zane is poisoning him, while Amaranta "cures" him with the addictive drug. When Zane disappeared from Straff's camp, Amaranta attempted to kill Straff with a poison. Straff realizes her betrayal, and in a fit of rage, strangles Amaranta to death. Straff nearly died but survived with a random antidote he made himself.
He was killed by [[Vin\|Vin]] after letting the [[Koloss\|koloss]] army attack Luthadel. Control of his army was given to [[Janarle\|Janarle]] who was forced to swear allegiance to Elend.

## Relationships
### Elend
[[Elend\|Elend]] is Straff's only known legitimate child. Straff is constantly disappointed in Elend, and constantly belittles him. His abuse includes forcing Elend to sleep with a skaa prostitute when he was just thirteen, saying it was about time he became a man. In the aftermath of the Lord Ruler's death, Straff flees from Luthadel, abandoning Elend to fend for himself. Elend not only survives, but makes a deal with the rioting skaa, and reigns briefly as king of the Central Dominance. Straff amasses his own force in his home dominance, and marches them to Luthadel to attempt to take the city from Elend, who he sees as weak.

### Zane
Straff's relationship with [[Zane\|Zane]] is arguably even more strained. Straff bribes Zane with [[Atium\|atium]] to keep him in line, since he fears what Zane might do to him in his insanity. However, Straff is unaware that Zane has his own atium stash, and the two maintain an uneasy truce, while repeatedly trying to kill each other.

### Mistresses
Straff has many mistresses and sires many illegitimate children in an attempt to acquire more [[Allomancy\|Mistborn]] and Mistings. His attempts are successful, and though among his many children [[Zane\|Zane]] is his only Mistborn, his Misting children number around eighteen.
Straff's proclivities regarding his mistresses are depraved, even for a Luthadel nobleman. He is fond of skaa brothels and goes to them regularly. He describes [[Amaranta\|Amaranta]], who is in her late twenties at the time, as having been quite attractive a decade before and says she is now too old to be attractive. He usually gets rid of his mistresses long before they reach her age. He parades a mistress who bears a resemblance to Vin, who is perhaps fifteen years old before Elend and Vin, in an effort to induce a reaction and intimidate them with this display of casual cruelty.
Several of these mistresses, including Amaranta, serve a purpose other than pleasure and attempting to have Allomantically gifted children. Amaranta acts as Straff’s chief herbalist, which is why he keeps her with him even after he no longer finds her attractive.

## Trivia
Although Brandon does not speak German, he researched Germanic morphemes to come up with several character names on Scadrial. Straff's name sounds like a German word for punishment (*strafe*), but this is just a coincidence.
