**Blome** is a [[Bronze\|bronze]] [[Misting\|Misting]] (aka a [[Seeker\|Seeker]]) and a bartender for Lord [[Winsting Innate\|Winsting Innate]] at his mansion in [[Elendel\|Elendel]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].

## History
Blome worked for House Innate for an unknown length of time, but he did more for Innate than simply tending bar. Blome was a Seeker, which allowed him to tell which of Winsting's guests were [[Allomancer\|Allomancers]]. He was present at an auction for Winsting's vote that took place in the year 342. He indicated to Winsting that no one there was burning any metals. When [[Paalm\|Paalm]] assassinated Winsting, Blome was presumably among those killed in the fighting.
