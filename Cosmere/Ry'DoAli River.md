The **Ry'DoAli River** (or simply **Ry'DoAli**) is a major river in [[Lossand\|Lossand]] on the [[Dayside\|Dayside]] of [[Taldain\|Taldain]].

## Etymology
The name "Ry'DoAli" is [[Kerztian\|Kerztian]] for "The Vein of Cursed Waters." The river was given this name because Kerztians believe that so much water in one place is unholy, and they are typically wary of approaching it.

## Geography
The Ry'DoAli flows south from the [[KraeDa\|KraeDa]] mountains through the center of Lossand into the .
Most of Lossand's territory is barren until you approach the river, since [[Dorim vine\|dorim vines]] do not grow in the area's shallow sands. The river is the primary water source for Lossand, and it is only possible for society to exist near the river's banks. Although the river enables agriculture, grain grown on its banks is "stunted" due to poor soil conditions.
The capital of Lossand, [[Kezare\|Kezare]], is located on a pair of islands where the Ry'DoAli meets the [[Nor'Tallon River\|Nor'Tallon River]]. Ferries are used to transport people and goods between the shore and the islands of Kezare. The city of [[Lraezare\|Lraezare]] lies on the coast at the mouth of the river. The river is very wide and navigable by large ships, and smaller settlements can be seen along its length when sailing between Kezare and Lraezare.
