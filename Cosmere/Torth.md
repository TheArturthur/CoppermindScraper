**Torth** is an [[Elis\|Elisian]] soldier who traveled with Duchess [[Khrissalla\|Khrissalla's]] expedition to [[Dayside\|Dayside]], along with Captain [[Deral\|Deral]] and his unnamed lieutenant, [[Flennid\|Flennid]] and another unnamed soldier. His fate is unknown.

## Appearance
Torth wears tricorne hat of the Elisian military and the gray jacket of an Elisian soldier. His pants are khaki and paired with brown calf-length boots.

## History
On deck of the ship after passing through the [[Border Ocean\|Terminal Storm]], Professor [[Cynder\|Cynder]] notices Flennid checking his firearm openly while chatting with Private Torth and the third soldier. [[Baon\|Baon]] admonishes the group that they were ordered to keep their firearms hidden. When they arrive in the [[Kerztian\|Kerztian]] port of [[Dosha-Har'Ken\|Dosha-Har'Ken]], Flennid and Torth disembark, leaving the third soldier on the ship to assist in offloading their luggage while Private Torth guards the offloaded supplies on the dock. 
While travelling the Kerla, near [[Esh'Ker'Losh\|Esh'Ker'Losh]], Flennid warns Private Torth to watch for trouble from the [[DaiKeen\|warriors]] they pass.
Upon arriving at the [[Diem\|Diem's]] tents near Mount KraeDa, Flennid and Torth ride ahead because of the possibility of finding water—instead they discovered the massacre of the [[Sand master\|sand masters]]. When Torth showed [[Daazk\|Daazk]] one of the sashes, Daazk panicked and fled, shouting the Kerztian word for [[Sand master\|sand masters]]—Ry'Kensha. Flennid, not understanding the situation, thought he was yelling to summon an ambush and shot him in the back as he rode away. Baon orders Torth to assist Flennid in recovering Daazk's body to bring back to the tents. While Khriss and Baon are in the tent inventorying supplies, Flennid and Torth stole the [[Tonk\|tonk]] that carried the party's water and food, then fled back in the direction of the port.
