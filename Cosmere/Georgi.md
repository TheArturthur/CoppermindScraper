**Waterlog** was an [[Epic\|Epic]] with water-manipulation abilities. Prior to becoming an Epic, he was a street thug from Orlando known as **Georgi**.

## History
[[Regalia\|Regalia]] claimed to have turned Georgi into an Epic, although his powers were actually granted by [[Calamity (Epic)\|Calamity]].
At some point, Waterlog was killed, presumably by the [[Reckoners\|Reckoners]]. His cells were turned into a [[Motivator\|motivator]] that [[Knighthawk Foundry\|Knighthawk Foundry]] used to create the [[Spyril\|spyril]].

## Legacy
The spyril became a key tool for the Reckoners, used first by [[Sam (Reckoner)\|Sam]], and later by [[David Charleston\|David Charleston]]. When Regalia attempted to have Calamity turn David into an Epic, she suggested that he should be given the same powers as Waterlog.
