**Dao** is a [[Seon\|seon]], a magical being from [[Sel\|Sel]]. He is bonded to [[Kaise\|Kaise]], an [[Arelene\|Arelene]], and joins her in the service of the [[Ghostbloods\|Ghostbloods]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. He is named for [[/wiki/Aon#Dao]], which means "stability" or "security".
Dao shares the characteristics and presumably the abilities of other seons. His "body" consists of a glowing, melon-sized sphere of shimmering white light with Aon Dao faintly visible at its center. He moves by floating, and is able to link to other seons to instantly communicate across great distances and even different [[Realmatic Theory\|realms]]. Dao speaks with a soft voice; unlike Kaise, he does not use [[Connection\|Connection]] "tricks" to speak the local language on Scadrial.

## History
Dao was not seen in [[Kaise\|Kaise's]] youth on [[Sel\|Sel]]. He is first seen at her side when she is an adult member of the [[Ghostblood\|Ghostbloods]] using the codename "Codenames Are Stupid". The pair were members of a mission on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]] to resist [[Trell\|Trell]] and undermine the [[Set\|Set]], in a team that included [[Moonlight\|Moonlight]] and [[TwinSoul\|TwinSoul]]. Dao facilitated communication of the team with [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]], who presumably had his own [[Seon\|seon]].
Dao met [[Marasi Colms\|Marasi Colms]] after [[Moonlight\|Moonlight]] brought her to the Ghostblood safehouse. Dao spoke to Marasi in the [[Aonic\|Aonic]] language; Kaise translated and told Marasi that he had complimented her hair. Marasi, who heard his name as "Dae-oh", was generally baffled by Dao's existence.
