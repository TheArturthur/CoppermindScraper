## Appearance and Personality
Stargyle is tall, friendly, and handsome with a ready smile. He has the build of a soldier, although he refuses to wear a soldier's uniform anymore. The [[Lighteyed\|lighteyed]] women of the [[Alethi\|Alethi]] court have a favorable opinion of him.

## Attributes and Abilities
Stargyle is a [[Order of Lightweavers\|Lightweaver]], bonded to an unknown [[Cryptic\|cryptic]]. This grants him access to the [[Surges\|surges]] of Illumination and Transformation. He is particularly skilled at seeing into [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]]. When he creates illusions, his method of focus is to act as if he were painting.

## History
Stargyle was born to a pigmenter, so he grew up viewing the world through its colors. He likely was born with a different name and took the name of Stargyle later. At some point he served as a soldier, married, and found his way to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]].
[[Shallan\|Shallan]] recruited Stargyle into her group of Lightweavers, which she began calling the [[Unseen Court\|Unseen Court]]. As he was one of the newest recruits, and therefore least known to her, she asked him to accompany the diplomatic mission to [[Lasting Integrity\|Lasting Integrity]]. At the last minute, however, his wife fell ill and he had to back out of the trip. [[Beryl\|Beryl]] asked to accompany the envoy to the [[Honorspren\|honorspren]] instead.
Stargyle ended up accompanying the [[Coalition of monarchs\|coalition's]] force that recaptured [[Emul\|Emul]]. When [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] determined that the best way for him to learn to use his [[Bondsmith\|Bondsmith]] abilities was to speak to [[Ishar\|Ishar]], [[Sigzil\|Sigzil]] took Stargyle and a couple of [[Windrunner\|Windrunners]] to scout out the situation in [[Tukar\|Tukar]]. On their return, Stargyle was able to create an illusion for Dalinar that played out a depiction of what the group saw as they flew over Ishar's army.

## Trivia
Stargyle is a cameo for Steve Argyle, the artist who did illustrations of each order of the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] for *The Way of Kings* leatherbound Kickstarter and some of the interior art for *The Way of Kings* leatherbound edition.
