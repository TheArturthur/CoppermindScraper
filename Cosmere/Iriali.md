## Appearance and Anatomy
The Iriali have metallic golden-blond skin and hair that breeds true. They mostly have yellow eyes. They have had what most would consider to be inhuman ancestry, depending on what is considered human.

## Culture

The Iriali, while on Roshar, are particular about chastity laws, and dislike public nudity. They tend to be less quarrelsome and prudish than the [[Vorin\|Vorin]] nations.

### Clothing
Iriali men often wear only waist wraps on warmer days. Iriali people are known to paint their skin with colors and patterns.

### Religion
The Iriali worship a god they call "One". According to this belief, the One knew everything but had experienced nothing. And so the One became Many in order to experience all things. As each experience is different, it brings completeness to the One. Eventually, all will be gathered back in when the seventh land is attained and they will once again become One. Every person is a different mind of a single being experiencing different lives. As Many, they need ignorance. Each fragment of the One’s mind has its own body with different passions and inclinations. They exist in variety to experience all kinds of thought. That means some people must know and others must not. Just like some people must be rich and others poor. The more religious segments of the Iriali on Roshar would approve of homosexuality, because they believe life is about new experiences. The general view of the Iriali on it, however, is currently unknown.
This religion and its philosophy of one becoming many may be slightly influenced by the [[Shattering\|Shattering]] of [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]]. The philosophy behind the One is that the [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual Realm]] and the [[Beyond\|Beyond]] are the same thing and that, when a person dies, their soul goes with their [[Investiture\|Investiture]] to the Spiritual Realm. Most [[Cosmere\|cosmere]] philosophers disagree with this belief.
Some Iriali in [[Kasitor\|Kasitor]] have come to see [[Cusicesh\|Cusicesh]] as a god, though most only see it as a natural part of the city, and use it as a system of timekeeping.

### Language
They speak a language related to the Riran and Reshi languages.
On Lumar, and likely other planets on their Path, they developed a written script that was written vertically, from top to bottom. While the language is no longer spoken on Lumar after the exodus of the Iriali, it is still known and taught to noblemen.

## History
As part of their worship of One, the Iriali believe that they are part of something they call the "Long Trail," a series of seven Lands which all must be "attained" before they will become One again. The Fourth Land is [[Roshar\|Roshar]], which they arrived on from somewhere besides [[Ashyn\|Ashyn]] and separately from the rest of humanity.
One of the lands after [[Roshar\|Roshar]] may have been [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]], where there is a population of golden haired "fairy people" according to [[Maraga Dulcet\|Maraga Dulcet]]. However, this is but a mere assumption.
One of the subsequent Lands is [[Lumar\|Lumar]], which they seemingly vanished from overnight about three hundred years before [[Hoid\|Hoid]] gained access to [[AonDor\|AonDor]] from [[Riina\|Riina]]. Their leaving the system had some kind of connection with the arrival of [[Xisis\|Xisis]] around the same time.

## Trivia
The Iriali will have a role to play during the space age of the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]].
