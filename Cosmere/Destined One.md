## Powers and Abilities
The Destined One has the ability to reach worlds outside of Mirandus, while remaining bound to Mirandus. The Destined One can travel to and from [[Earth (Dark One)\|Earth]], as [[Illarion\|Illarion]] does where he works for [[Mitchell and Young\|Mitchell and Young]]. They can create a portal to allow other people to travel between worlds as well. Their magic is said to edit the words of the [[Narrative\|Narrative]] itself, despite the Narrative being self writing.

## History
Prior to the rise of [[Malmahan\|Malmahan]] the Uncalled, for every Dark One's rise, a Destined One rose up to fight and defeat them. With Malmahan's rise, no Destined One rose up to oppose him, and so Illarion took it upon himself to defeat a second Dark One, the first Destined One to ever do so.
With [[Paul Tanasin\|Paul Tanasin's]] rise as the latest Dark One, Illarion proclaimed [[Kraisis\|Kraisis]] as his successor after [[Gosovic\|Gosovic]] would not allow him to fight a third Dark One. However, Kraisis was the first Destined One to fail, as Paul defeated him in combat and bound his soul to bring forth more [[Drull\|drull]].
