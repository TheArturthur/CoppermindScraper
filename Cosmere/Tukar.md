## Etymology
Tukar is derived from Tuk, a local name for the Herald [[Talenel\|Talenel]].

## Geography
Tukar lies in south-western Roshar, on the coast of the [[Southern Depths\|Southern Depths]] and the [[Aimian Sea\|Aimian Sea]], in the geographical region of [[Makabak\|Makabak]]. It borders [[Emul\|Emul]] to the north and [[Marat\|Marat]] to the west, both on rivers. The island chain leading from Tukar to Aimia are possibly under Tukari control. The general climate of the country is unknown. It's likely to be hot and dry, much like the rest of Makabak.
Tukar has several settlements, such as [[Torriqqam\|Torriqqam]] and [[Khathazan\|Khathazan]]. Along the Southern Depths, there are also the towns of [[Riqu Mar\|Riqu Mar]] and [[Linder Mar\|Linder Mar]]. [[Icewater\|Icewater]], located on one of the islands off the coast, may belong to it. [[Sesemalex Dar\|Sesemalex Dar]], the capital of Emul, is located on the western border of Tukar, and the Tukari have laid claim to it for generations. Due to their claim of ownership, there is a strong sense of anti-Emuli irredentism in the hearts of the people, which has led to many separate conflicts over the city over the centuries.
Tukar has an area of around 702,000 km.

## History
>“*The war between Emul and Tukar was heating up. Granted, everyone was always saying that. But things **had** changed over the last few years.*”
\-Hauka[8]


### The Heraldic Epochs
During the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]] era, Tukar was part of [[Makabakam\|Makabakam]]. At some point, Makabakam splintered into smaller states, with Tukar being one of them.

### The Era of Solitude
When the [[Azir\|Azish Empire]] began to form, Tukar might've joined them, although their status within the coalition, if it even is part of the coalition, is confusing.
The nations of Tukar and Emul have been in the state of on-and-off conflict for centuries, with the main point of contention being the city of [[Sesemalex Dar\|Sesemalex Dar]]. This was done due to a combination of the religious value ascribed to Sesemalex Dar by both sides, and due to its effectiveness and value as a port city.

#### Rise of Tezim and the Eighty's War
Around 1167, Ishar rose to power as the God-Priest of Tukar. As the leader, he began to lead a new conflict against Emul for control of Sesemalex Dar, known as the [[Eighty's War\|Eighty's War]]. Shortly before the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]], in 1173, the fighting grew in ferocity. At the same time, tensions with [[Marat\|Marat]] began to rise, leading some to theorize that they may quickly turn their aggression to them instead.

### The True Desolation
  Map of the war in Emul
When the True Desolation began, [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] sent messages to both Emul and Tukar, hoping that at least one of them would join his alliance. Tukar outright refused, with the god-priest demanding that, as an "aspect of the ", he should be the one in charge of [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] and the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]], they quickly refused to submit to his demands.
During the Desolation, [[Voidspren\|voidspren]] began appearing in [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]] in the region equivalent to Tukar. Nonetheless, by the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]], the country is still considered to be neutral in the conflict.

#### The Emuli Offensive
They played a major role in the Emuli Offensive in 1175, fighting against Alethi and Azish forces and the Coalition of Monarchs who were attempting to push the occupying Fused out of Emul. They primarily set up their armies in northeastern Tukar, around the [[Drunmu Basin\|Drunmu Basin]].



## Politics and Culture
  <<Tezim\|Tezim>>, the god-priest of Tukar
The people of Tukar are typically brown-skinned and have black hair. Their clothes have colours similar to Azish patterns. The cloth is thicker and coarser then Azish clothing. Their outfits are also more enveloping then Azish clothing and have braided tassels that hang low from the waist. This style is common in the south east of Makabak.
The Tukari wear colored bracelets, Dalinar thinks they have religious significance, although he’s uncertain. At least some of these bracelets are made from cloth, they may also have writing on them.
The Tukari are renowned across Roshar for their mercenaries, their perfumes and their jewellery. There are many herdsmen in Tukar.

### Government and Religion
Tukar is a theocracy, with their current spiritual and political leader, Tezim, being alternately titled the god-priest, god-king, and priest-king. The Tukari people also live in clans.
Unlike other Makabaki states, which consider [[Herald\|Heralds]] to be gods, the Tukari worship the , much like the eastern nations. Tezim is likewise revered as a semi-divine figure, and considered an aspect of god. Other titles ascribed to him are "first and last man", "Herald of Heralds" and "bearer of the [[Oathpact\|Oathpact]]". In reality, Tezim is the half-mad Herald [[Ishar\|Ishar]], making those titles somewhat justified. Though the average Tukari likely don't know his true identity, there are numerous odd rumors swirling about him outside of the country.

### Military
The Tukari are highly militaristic. Tukar itself has numerous , which it has put to good use in Eighty's War. It is not known if they have any [[Shardblade\|Shardblades]] or [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]], though their military is considered highly capable.
The Tukari Soldiers in Tezim’s army don’t wear proper uniforms, they are seen wearing hogshide battle leathers with hardened cuirasses painted a dark blue. Most of them are armed with spears, though some of them have steel swords.
The Tukari Military is highly mobile with [[Ishar\|Ishar]] being able summon perpendicularities and hop in and out of Shadesmar.

### International relations
>“*I'd rather have the Emuli anyway. Their soldiers might be less capable, but they’re also… well, **not crazy**.*”
\-Navani[1]


Technically, Tukar appears to be part of the greater [[Azir\|Azish Empire]], and the [[Prime Aqasix\|Prime Aqasix]] seems to have the capacity to summon the god-priest to [[Azimir\|Azimir]] whenever they wish. However, for generations now Tukar has been at war with [[Emul\|Emul]], another Azish member state, putting the Prime's ability to control it in question. The conflict is centered around the city of [[Sesemalex Dar\|Sesemalex Dar]], considered holy by both the Emuli and the Tukari. While the Emuli consider it their ancestral homeland, the Tukari motivations for the conflict are unknown. In the East, there is some confusion over whether the conflict is purely religious or economical, as Sesemalex Dar is an excellent port.
Tukari in general are considered volatile and crazy by the outsiders, with the  relieved at not having to ally with them, and [[Szeth\|Szeth]] speculating that they might suddenly abandon their crusade against Emul and go to war with [[Marat\|Marat]]. The main way of communicating with them diplomatically is through their scribes, with the god-priest himself rarely, if ever, speaking in person.
