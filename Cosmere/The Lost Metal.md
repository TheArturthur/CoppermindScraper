\-For years, frontier lawman turned big-city senator Waxillium Ladrian has hunted the shadowy organization the Setwith his late uncle and his sister among their leaderssince they started kidnapping people with the power of Allomancy in their bloodlines. When Detective Marasi Colms and her partner Wayne find stockpiled weapons bound for the Outer City of Bilming, this opens a new lead. Conflict between Elendel and the Outer Cities only favors the Set, and their tendrils now reach to the Elendel Senatewhose corruption Wax and Steris have sought to exposeand Bilming is even more entangled.
After Wax discovers a new type of explosive that can unleash unprecedented destruction and realizes that the Set must already have it, an immortal kandra serving Scadrial's god reveals that Harmony's power is blocked in Bilming. That means the city has fallen under the influence of another god: Trell, worshipped by the Set. And Trell isn't the only factor at play from the larger CosmereMarasi is recruited by offworlders with strange abilities who claim their goal is to protect Scadrial... at any cost.
Harmony's vision of future possibilities comes to an abrupt halt tomorrow night, with only blackness after that. It's a race against time, and Wax must choose whether to set aside his rocky relationship with God and once again become the Sword that Harmony has groomed him to be. If no one steps forward to be the hero Scadrial needs, the planet and its millions of people will come to a sudden and calamitous ruin.

## Development
Following completion of *The Alloy of Law* Brandon plotted out three more books, following the same characters, to finish the story. Brandon began writing *The Lost Metal* in April 2021, after he finished *Cytonic*, and completed the first draft on August 4, 2021. The second draft was completed on September 20, 2021, and went to beta readers and Brandon's editor shortly thereafter; the beta reads concluded some time in November. The post-beta read edit was done by March 7, 2022; it took more time to complete than Brandon had expected and resulted in the book growing longer than he had initially anticipated. After that, Brandon did one final edit, which was done by May 24, 2022, before turning the book in to Tor for a November 15, 2022 release, around when the first two Era 2 books were released in leatherbound.
The book includes some information relevant to the broader [[Cosmere\|cosmere]], including the identity of [[Trell (Trellism)\|Trell]], the nature of [[Trellium\|trellium]], and some clues about [[Kelsier\|Kelsier's]] plans. Most of those elements are more foreshadowing for [[Mistborn Era 3\|Mistborn Era 3]] and the book mostly focuses on the characters of [[Wax\|Wax]], [[Wayne\|Wayne]], [[Steris\|Steris]], and [[Marasi\|Marasi]], though Brandon also considers the book to be slightly more cosmere-aware than any other book he has written. The book begins with a [[Wayne\|Wayne]] flashback, rather than one of [[Wax\|Wax]]. Early in the development process, Brandon envisioned Wax having essentially retired and the book opening with Wayne as Marasi's deputy. The book includes a broadsheet, like the other books in *Mistborn* Era 2.
The first draft of the book was about 149,000 words total; in the third draft, it grew by about 25,000 words. In the first draft, Part One was about 30,000 words and had two separate narratives, each with two of the main characters, and alternated viewpoints between all four main characters; Part Two was about 45,000 words and brought all four of the main characters together, continuing to alternate viewpoints; and in Part Three, the characters split again, with Marasi on her own arc of about 30,000 words, Wax and Wayne together for an arc of about 40,000 words, and Steris on her own for a short arc of about 10,000 words. Brandon wrote each of the arcs of Part Three separately from each other, which he found was a good approach as it essentially let him write the ending three times and he likes writing endings. In total, Brandon predicted that Steris would have around seven or eight viewpoints. The epilogue is a bit longer than normal, as it is the last book of Era 2 and Brandon wanted to linger with the characters and setting a little more.

### Pre-Publication Content

Brandon mentioned at JordanCon that he thinks there is a mention of the [[Shard\|Shard]] [[Whimsy\|Whimsy]] in the book.
