>“* The Grand Aurora encircled the entire world, and even the mightiest storms did little more than churn its mother-of-pearl shimmering. The Aurora defeated storms; that was how I knew I’d someday be able to do it too.*”
\- Kai about the Grand Aurora[1]


The **Grand Aurora** is a celestial phenomenon on [[Alornia\|Alornia]], a source of constant blue-violet light in the sky. It encompasses all of Alornia, and gives out mother-of-pearl shimmering that can be seen through even the worst weather conditions. When dark, the Aurora faintly lights the ground, making everything look slightly blue.
The Grand Aurora gives off a constant energy, though this energy is only noticeable when an individual has entered [[/wiki/Lancing#Lancesight]]. While in Lancesight the Aurora can be seen indoors, even through stone ceilings, and its energy can be felt as a warm, pulsing rhythm on the skin. This energy allows the Aurora to act as a constant energy source for [[Lancing\|Lancing]].
As the Grand Aurora is programming specific to Alornia, it only manifests in Alornia and the connected [[/wiki/State#Border States]]. Similar phenomena can likely be found in other [[State\|States]].
