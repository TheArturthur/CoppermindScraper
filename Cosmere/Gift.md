**Gift** is an [[Unkalaki\|Unkalaki]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. He is [[Lunamor\|Lunamor]] and [[Tuaka\|Tuaka's]] eldest son, and a twin brother to [[Cord\|Cord]]. The young boy is very tall and pale-skinned. He is [[Vorin\|Vorin]], and wears a [[Glyphward\|glyphward]] tied to his arm.. Per his culture's traditions, he has the honor of gathering food as his occupation.
Like his father and sister, Gift may be able to [[Sighted\|see]] [[Spren\|spren]]. Gift is the only one of his siblings who speaks enough [[Alethi\|Alethi]] to manage a passable greeting when he arrives on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]].

## History
Gift converted to [[Vorinism\|Vorinism]], with his father's blessing, by [[Veden\|Veden]] monks who came to the [[Horneater Peaks\|Horneater Peaks]] during the time when he was growing up there. His father, who had left the Peaks with [[Kef'ha\|Kef'ha]] almost a year before, sent his family a message summoning them as soon as he had saved up enough wages. Gift and his family traveled for months, arriving at the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] in 1174. Their caravan was raided by [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]] on the Plains, so he and his family barricaded themselves behind a pile of furniture. During the attack, a member of his family shot a Voidbringer with an [[Unkalaki\|Unkalaki]] arrow. They were found shortly after this by [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]] and taken to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]]. Lunamor was surprised by how much Gift had grown during the time he was away. After settling in in Urithiru, Gift helped his father serve food and drink to [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]]. He liked [[Lift\|Lift]] and often left food out for her to "steal".
Along with his sister [[Cord\|Cord]], Gift chose to stay at Urithiru when Lunamor returned to the Peaks with the rest of his family.
