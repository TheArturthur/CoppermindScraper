**Migs** is a gang leader in [[Elendel\|Elendel]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
Migs ran a crew of eight crooks. In 342 [[Catacendre\|PC]], the crew attempted a heist of some kind and things went seriously wrong. Migs shot two constables, although they survived their wounds.
Migs and his gang holed up in their hideout, located in an old pub. They barricaded themselves in overnight; the constabulary attempted to negotiate, telling Migs he would not be hanged for his crimes, but he refused to surrender. In the morning, [[Wax\|Wax]] and [[Wayne\|Wayne]] were called in to raid the hideout despite the fact that Wax's wedding to [[Steris\|Steris]] was scheduled later in the day. Wax easily broke through the crew's barricade, drawing their gunfire and deflecting it with a [[Steel\|steel]] bubble. Meanwhile, Wayne sneaked in undetected; he punched Migs and knocked out a number of his thugs (including [[Guillian\|Guillian]] and [[Slink\|Slink]]) while Wax kicked [[Drawers\|Drawers]] in the chin. Migs indicated that he would rather die than be apprehended, and questioned why Wax had not killed them all with his [[Allomantic\|Allomantic]] powers. Wax told Migs that he wasn't worth killing, and finally convinced him to surrender.
