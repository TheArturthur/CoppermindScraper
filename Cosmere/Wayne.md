**Wayne** is a [[Twinborn\|Twinborn]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]; a [[Bendalloy\|bendalloy]] [[Misting\|Misting]] (aka a Slider) as well as a [[Gold\|gold]] [[Ferring\|Ferring]] (aka a [[Bloodmaker\|Bloodmaker]]). He is a friend and colleague of [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]], and the duo worked together to solve crimes in the [[Roughs\|Roughs]]. Later, Wayne joined the [[Elendel\|Elendel]] constabulary as a detective. When the [[Set\|Set]] tried to blow up [[Elendel\|Elendel]] with a bomb, Wayne sacrificed himself to stop the bomb and save the city. Wayne is extremely talented at disguises and uses one frequently. He is also often inappropriately joking or "trading" belongings without permission.

## Appearance and Personality
 by  Shuravf 
>“*Wax was a right good fellow, but there were a lot of things he didn't understand. Women for one. Hats for another.*”
\-Wayne[9]


For more images, see [[Wayne/Gallery\|/Gallery]].
Wayne is short, lean, and muscular, with a round, sharp-chinned face. At the time of the hunt for the Vanishers he was about 30 years old. He prefers to dress in Roughs clothing with a duster coat. He has an affinity for hats, which he says are essential to completing his elaborate disguises. He cannot grow a "proper" beard.
He has an easygoing personality and is often seen manipulating his accent and style of speech depending on who he is with. He and Wax often exchange witty banter when together.
Wayne has little to no concept of boundaries and an almost pathological need to prove that he's not a bad person. He is deeply troubled and has , and did not cope well with the isolation he faced in the Roughs. Wayne also has a problem with . This is seen in his multiple episodes of "trading" items of different value and then making up convoluted reasons for why this "trade" is acceptable. Wayne often has trouble taking things seriously and often makes inappropriate jokes, especially around [[Marasi\|Marasi]]. However, he is sometimes capable of having a serious and helpful conversation.

>“*Maybe I can’t ever do enough good to balance the bad I done. Maybe I’ll always be worthless.*”
\-Wayne talking to Wax[22]

Wayne struggles with self-loathing, and sometimes thinks that he does more harm than he does good. He deeply regrets his mistakes in the past, and thinks himself to be beyond forgiveness.

## Attributes & Abilities
### Metallic Arts
Wayne is both a [[Ferring\|Ferring]] and a [[Misting\|Misting]], making him a [[Twinborn\|Twinborn]]. He is both a Bloodmaker and a Slider.

#### Feruchemy
>“*Not that the pain went completely away, mind you. But he and pain were old friends what shared a handshake and a beer now and then. Didn’t much like each other, but they had a working relationship.*”
\-Wayne[23]


As a [[Bloodmaker\|Bloodmaker]], Wayne can store health in his goldminds at the price of being unwell. He can tap into his stores later to heal wounds. As long as Wayne has an adequate storage of health, he can recover from any wounds that aren't immediately lethal, such as curing poison, regrowing fingers, and surviving bullet wounds. He prefers to fill his metalminds all at once by spending weeks sick in bed instead of traveling around while slightly sick. He often stores health whenever he has a hangover as he is going to have a horrible time of it anyway. He sometimes uses his ability as a Bloodmaker strategically, by pretending that a bullet has actually killed him or incapacitated him, in order to make enemies dismiss him as a threat in a fight. However, many who know of his abilities aren’t fooled by this trick. He eventually embeds his goldminds deep into his thigh to protect them from Allomancers.

 by  Elisgardor 
#### Allomancy
>“*A large group of Vanishers had set up near the western tunnel, firing out at Wayne - who was in full form, burning through his bendalloy like a madman. He'd appear, draw fire, then vanish into a blur, then appear right next to where he'd been. He called insults as the bullets missed him, then moved again.*”
\-Wax watching Wayne fight at the Vanisher hideout[27]


As a [[Slider\|Slider]], Wayne can burn bendalloy to form a "speed bubble" around himself, speeding up time for anyone inside it. Once the bubble is made it cannot be moved, and Wayne can move about freely inside it, but if he leaves it, it will disappear. Anything moving from one side to the other, like a bullet, will be slightly thrown off course by the edge of the bubble. Using one nugget of bendalloy Wayne can compress two minutes of time into approximately fifteen external seconds. Wayne often uses speed bubbles to converse in private, change in to a disguise or engage in a fight uninterrupted.
In the six years following the events at the [[Sovereign's temple\|Sovereign's temple]], Wayne practices extensively with bendalloy that he is able to purchase thanks to his newfound immense wealth. This leads him to be able to drastically reduce the time between activating his speed bubbles, as well as granting him a high degree of control over their size and shape.
While trying to stop the Set in Bilming, Wayne burns a small amount of [[Lerasium\|lerasium]], making him a [[Allomancy\|Mistborn]].

#### Hemalurgy
While trying to stop the Set in Bilming, Wax gives Wayne a [[Steel\|steel]] spike, granting him Allomantic steel.

### Fighting
Wayne's preferred method of fighting is to move in close to one opponent, create a speed bubble, and use his dueling canes for a close quarters one on one. In some cases, when he’s in disguise, he’ll use a set of wooden knucklebones as a melee weapon, employing the same speed bubble strategy that he uses with his dueling canes. After beating his opponent he will drop the bubble and leap to the next one, starting the process over again. He seems adept at fighting, even against men with guns, though he does get shot on occasion, making his healing abilities extremely useful during combat. When under heavy fire, Wayne uses his speed bubbles to abruptly change the direction he’s running, this making it harder for enemies to draw a bead on him. 

### Disguises
>“*He had beggar costumes, constable costumes, and old lady costumes. A fellow needed to be able to blend in with his surroundings.[28]*”
\-Wayne


Wayne is talented at disguising himself using various costumes and voices, and has been able to pose as various races, ages, and genders. He is a master at picking up accents and considers it the only thing he is allowed to steal. Even when living in the Roughs he makes trips into the city for the purpose of picking up new accents. With the right hat and accent Wayne can easily disguise himself well enough to trick criminals or policemen into thinking he is one of them. He uses his disguises to gain information, sneak into places he otherwise couldn’t enter, interrogate criminals, or just for his own amusement.

>“*It's uncanny how you do that. You imitate a person nearly as well as one of my kin.*”
\-VenDell to Wayne[34]

He is known to be a method actor often thinking like the person he is disguised as. [[MeLaan\|MeLaan]] says that he is 'Wasted as a human' when referring to his talent for accents. His skill with impersonation rivals that of even the kandra.

## History
 by  Linnéa Sandberg 
### Tinweight Settlement
>“*You are whatever you want to be, Wayne. You're the wind. You're the stars. You are all endless things.*”
\-Wayne's mother reciting a poem to Wayne[1]


Wayne's father worked at [[Tinweight Settlement\|Tinweight Settlement]] during Wayne's childhood and [[Wayne's mother\|his mother]] did laundry back at home.  When Wayne's father died in a mining accident, Wayne's uncle [[Gregr\|Gregr]] moved in with them and built a variety of furniture for them to save money. They lived next to the mine. When Gregr also died in a mining accident Wayne's mother had to go and work at the mine herself and Wayne had to take up doing the laundry to make additional money. Wayne got into the habit of taking things from people and planned to earn a good living playing cards. His mother died in another collapse at the mine. 

### Time in the Roughs
>“*Some mistakes though, you can’t fix by being sorry. Can’t fix them no matter what you do.*”
\-Wayne[24]


Wayne's father was a [[Feruchemist\|Feruchemist]], and Wayne was aware of his abilities by the time he was sixteen, but never had access to any [[Bendalloy\|bendalloy]] or [[Gold\|gold]]. Wayne had a natural talent for grabbing things without meaning to, and with encouragement from some friends he starting pick pocketing, and eventually robbed [[Durkel\|a man]] at gunpoint. He accidentally killed the man, and was easily caught by the local lawman [[Jon Deadfinger\|Jon Deadfinger]]. At the trial he found out that the man he killed had been a bookkeeper, charity worker, and father of three. Wax saved Wayne from being hanged, though the details of how are unknown. Ever since the two worked together almost like a sheriff and deputy, becoming famous enough to be taught about in University. As a reaction to the death of the bookkeeper, Wayne became unable to hold a gun without his hands shaking, preferring to use dueling canes instead. He also began sending half of the money he made to the man's widow to help pay for her kids, one of whom was able to go to university. He visited [[Allriandre\|Allriandre]], the eldest child, at the University on the first day of every month to give her "blood money," but she did not forgive him.
Wayne spent much of his early adulthood as Wax’s partner, initially performing smaller tasks like keeping an eye on [[Destroyer\|Wax's horse]], though eventually became more adept at fighting, and eventually began to fight alongside Wax.

### Investigating the Vanishers
>“*Kidnapping people… well, there’s something goin' on here. I’m gonna find out what it is. With or without you.*”
\-Wayne to Wax about the Vanishers[7]


With Wax's return to the city, Wayne was left in charge of [[Weathering\|Weathering]], a small town out in the Roughs, appearing now on the trail of the Vanishers; an infamous gang of thieves renowned for their bizarre theatrics and efficiency.
Wayne went to Elendel to meet up with Wax again, intruding on a meeting with [[Jackstom Harms\|Jackstom Harms]] and posing as Wax's uncle. He tells Wax in private about the Vanishers, trying to convince Wax to go after them.
Wax attended the [[Yomen-Ostlin wedding dinner\|Yomen-Ostlin wedding dinner]], and Wayne went there disguised as a waiter. The Vanishers attacked, and Wax and Wayne were forced to fight. Together they manage to quell the Vanisher attack, the survivors fleeing, carrying off [[Steris\|Steris]]. In addition, the bandit leader [[Tarson\|Tarson]] took Wayne’s lucky hat, infuriating Wayne.

>“*Just gotta talk their language, son. Surprising how many people never figure that out.*”
\-Wayne to Sindren[32]

Wayne infiltrated the Fourth Octant Constabulary, disguised as a constable, and interrogated a few of the captured Vanishers, pretending to be a Vanisher himself. Using his skill with accents and acting, he managed to find out the location of one of the Vanisher hideouts. Wayne met with Wax and Marasi at Wax's mansion, and [[Tillaume\|Wax's butler]] tries to assassinate them, using a bomb. Wayne used his abilities as a Slider to give them time to react, and Wax used his feruchemy to allow them to escape the blast by falling through the floor. Wayne used himself as a human shield, able to heal himself using his own feruchemy. Using the information that Wayne had gathered, they investigated the Vanisher hideout. Though it was empty, Wayne found a cigar box that pointed them to [[Miles Dagouter\|Miles Dagouter]].

 by  ShiroXIX 
While on a train ride to the Outer Estates, Miles attacked their train and Wax managed to fight him off. They visited [[Ranette\|Ranette]] for help, though Wayne received a cold reception, Ranette threatening to shoot them. Wayne bribed Ranette into letting them in, using an aluminum gun he’d stolen from the investigation scene at the wedding. Wax laid out a plan, and Wayne stole some shipping manifests. Later, at a train station, Wayne disguised himself as an old lady to discover more information about the [[Breaknaught\|Breaknaught]], a heavily protected train designed to withstand attacks from the Vanishers. Wayne and some others caused some chaos, faking an attack. Wayne used the chaos to throw a "wounded" Wax into the train car, then proceeded to lock the door.

>“*You ever notice how often he gets to be the one who rides in comfort, while I have to do things like gallop or walk all the time? Not very fair.*”
\-Wayne to Marasi[40]

Wayne and Marasi watched the train from a hillside one evening, and observed how the Vanishers pulled off their robberies, by using a piece of machinery to swap out the train car. While Wax attacked from within the train car, Wayne and Marasi followed to the Vanisher hideout to provide assistance. Wayne got into the thick of the fighting at the hideout alongside Wax, while Marasi acted as a sniper from above.
Towards the end of the fighting Tarson took Marasi hostage, Wayne threw up a speed bubble for Wax, who managed to pull off a near impossible shot to kill Tarson. Wax then had a close quarters fight with Miles, Marasi discreetly burning cadmium to give Wayne time to go alert the constabulary. The constables arrived in time, and managed to capture Miles through sheer numbers.

### Chasing the Marksman
>“*Look, Wax. We've got to go! The Marksman has made his move!*”
\-Wayne arriving at Wax's manor[11]


Some time after Miles' capture, Wayne found Wax and told him the Marksman was on the move. They got in a motorcar with Marasi, and Wax then chased after the Marksman using Steelpushes. Wayne followed behind with Marasi, and the Marksman subsequently escaped into the slums. While Marasi and Wax went to go interrogate people, Wayne used his acting skill to join in with a group of men living in the slums. He followed one of the men to where Marks was hiding. He attacked the building and apprehended Marks. They were attacked as they left the slums, and Marks was shot and killed.

### Chasing Bleeder
>“*I killed your daddy. I mugged him in an alley for his pocketbook. I shot a better man than me, and because of that, I don't deserve to be alive.*”
\-Wayne to Alliandre[16]


Wax investigated a series of bodies at [[Winsting Innate\|Lord Winsting's]] manor, where a series of people were killed by a Steelrunner. Knowing that he’d likely need it soon, Wayne began storing up health. Wax wanted Wayne to got to [[The Village\|The Village]], but Wayne had to preform a special task he always did on the first of the month. He went to [[Elendel University\|Elendel University]], sneaking in to meet with [[Allriandre\|Allriandre]], the daughter of the man he killed. He offered her the usual monthly stipend that he gives her, and she showed him the picture of her father, forcing him to once again recite his crimes. She once again told him that he isn't forgiven, and Wayne left. Wayne and Wax visited the home of [[Idashwy\|Idashwy]], a known Terris Steelrunner. They found her dead with a hole in her chest. Wax and Wayne determined that the killer used Hemalurgy to steal Idashwy's Steelrunner abilities.

>“*Our accents are clothing for our thoughts, my dear. Without them, everything we say would be stripped bare, and we might as well be screaming at one another. Oh look. The dessert lady has chocolate pastries again!*”
\-Wayne to Marasi[28]

Wayne and Marasi went to [[Lady ZoBell's party\|Lady ZoBell's party]], but were turned away by the bouncer. Wayne used his bendalloy to determine that they were on a list of people to be kept out of the party, a petty move by the governor's bodyguard. Wayne decided to act the part of Professor Hanlanaze, a mathematics professor, to get into the party with Marasi as his assistant. A colleague later recognized him, and he threw up a speed bubble while Marasi figured out how to respond to him. Wayne bluffed the man into a hasty retreat and concentrated on eating again. At the party a young woman came up to him and slapped him, saying that he stole an invention from her now-destitute father. Wax found a suspicious server and chased him, Wayne tackling the man. He escaped, and Wayne stayed behind to protect the governor while Wax chased after him. Wayne conducted an impersonation of the party staff, and concluded that the server Wax chased was not Bleeder, as the choice of impersonating a new waiter that nobody liked was too obvious.

>“*Well hang me. You're that immortal, ain't you?*”
\-Wayne upon meeting MeLaan[45]

Wayne went to the temple of the Common Man, a location of a very loose religion revolving around [[Breeze\|Breeze]] and heavily involving alcohol. The temple was a bar, and many people in the place were morose or angry. Wayne cheered up everyone there by improving their beverages, and met [[MeLaan\|MeLaan]]. They got off well, having a belching contest before Wax arrived and interrupted them. MeLaan filled them in on more details about Bleeder, saying that they needed to take out her spike, either manually or with a serum inside of a syringe that MeLaan gave to Wax. While Wax investigated Bleeder's trail of clues, Wayne stayed to guard [[Replar Innate\|Governor Replar Innate]], later joined by MeLaan. Wayne bonded more with MeLaan during their time guarding Innate, coaching her on her accents.

### Rioting in Elendel
 by  GisAlmeida 
Wayne went out into the streets to blend in with an angry mob surrounding a Survivorist priest, but Bleeder used a syringe to reveal the priest as a kandra. Someone in the crowd recognized Wayne, and he was forced to flee the scene. Upon returning to Innate’s manor, he heard Innate speaking and realized that the accent was off, revealing that he was Bleeder.  Wayne investigated but got too close to the window, and Bleeder spotted him. She attacked him, getting his metal minds off, drugging him, and stashing him in the closet.
Wax later found him and rescued him before chasing off after Bleeder for the final time. Marasi decided that MeLaan should pose as the governor and give a speech to appease the rioting people of Elendel. Due to his wound from Bleeder’s attack, Wayne stayed onstage near MeLaan in case things went wrong. The speech didn’t work and the people began to riot. They stopped however, when [[Aradel\|Aradel]] put MeLaan under arrest for corruption. Aradel took control of the city, turning the crowds to his side.

### Death of Bleeder
>“*It’ll pass, mate. My pa once said to me, ‘Son, keep a stiff upper lip.’ So if things get bad, you bash your face against a wall till your lip bleeds, and you’ll feel better.*”
\-Wayne trying to console Wax[53]


After Wax returned from his chase of Bleeder, having killed her and found out that she had been [[Lessie\|Lessie]] all along, Wayne tried to help his friend with his grief at having killed his wife a second time. He saw the daughter of [[Remmingtel Tarcsel\|Remmingtel Tarcsel]], the girl who slapped him at ZoBell’s party when he had pretended to be Hanlanaze. He talked to her, recognizing her father as the true inventor of the incandescent lightbulb, and offered her venture capital to help her fund her and her father’s inventions, to her extreme delight.

### Search for the Bands
>“*Gonna go get smashed till I can’t piss straight. Happy weddings ‘n stuff*”
\-Wayne’s note to Wax[54]


Wax and Steris were scheduled to have their wedding in a Survivorist church, and Wayne sent a note to Wax telling him he wouldn’t be there. Wayne had “the lads” sabotage the wedding, telling them to flood the church. They toppled an entire water tower to flood the church, and Wayne didn’t expect them to go so far. He faked being a head chef for the wedding feast, ordering around young assistants until Marasi came to reprimand him. They talked, and Wayne decided at the end of the conversation to give up on Ranette and move on.
VenDell, a sixth generation Kandra who wanted to meet with Wax, decided to talk with Marasi instead. Wayne invited them over to Wax’s mansion, along with MeLaan. Wax arrived, and VenDell told them about the nature of Identity and Investiture, and of the possibilities of unkeyed and unsealed metalminds. Wayne went for a stroll through Elendel, and met Ranette to tell her that he was giving up on her.
Wayne, along with Wax, Marasi, Steris, and MeLaan, traveled to New Seran. Wayne enjoyed talking with people on the train and learning new accents. He also chatted with Marasi, Marasi asking him about being in Wax’s shadow. Wayne and MeLaan found a luggage compartment in the floor, and were making out for the rest of the train ride, MeLaan topless. Though the [[Nightstreet Gang\|Nightstreet Gang]] attacked the train, Wayne and MeLaan were too distracted to realize it. They only found out only afterward when Wax found them, fearing that something had happened to Wayne. Marasi was outraged at their behavior, but Wayne and MeLaan weren’t embarrassed.

 by  Egilde Art 
#### New Seran
The group arrived in New Seran, and they went to their hotel. Between Steris’s list of possible disasters, Wayne’s trading of objects, and MeLaan’s strangeness, [[Aunt Gin\|the hotel owner]] was quite alarmed. Since Wax doubted Wayne’s usefulness at [[Kelesina Shores's party\|Kelesina Shores's party]], Marasi borrowed Wayne to go dig through graves for ReLuur’s spike.

>“*Why, what happens when we have to thump some people, then run off with their ledgers? They’re gonna know it was us, and Wax’ll have to pay a big heap of compensatory fines.*”
\-Wayne to Marasi[12]

Wayne and Marasi went to a bank, Wayne planning for them to pose as a rich lord and his niece. Marasi however, shocked Wayne by using her status as a constable to let them talk to the bank’s owner. Wayne swapped a rats tail with the man’s silver letter opener, and Marasi discovered than all of the city’s graveyard workers are crooked. They went to a graveyard, and there Wayne disguised himself and Marasi, then talked to [[Dechamp\|Dechamp]], the night gravekeeper. Wayne bribed the man into digging up ReLuur’s grave. DeChamp however, sent his young assistant to alert members of the Set. A group of gunmen arrived, and opened fire immediately, accidentally killing Dechamp. Wayne and Marasi took cover in the freshly dug grave. Marasi supposed that the gunmen were so scared of Wayne's reputation that they had not waited for Dechamp to get clear preferring to kill Wayne without any chance for him to fight back; Wayne was immensely pleased at the thought that he was so feared by the criminals. Wayne and Marasi fought back against the gunmen, defeating several and causing the rest to retreat. Afterward, he went to the graveyard building, and found both Dechamp’s ledger and his stash of booze.
Both Wayne and Marasi worked together to trick [[Templeton Fig\|Templeton Fig]], Dechamp’s boss. They caused him to think that he was being visited by [[Marsh\|Death]], who was actually Wayne in disguise. Wayne learned from him that ReLuur’s spike had been sent to the small town of [[Dulsing\|Dulsing]]. Wax returned from the party, giving Wayne an unkeyed metalmind with a lot of healing stored in it.

#### Dulsing
>“*You can throw your wooden teeth at ‘em. Do some cane wagging as well. I’m sure you’re cross about stayin’ up so late.*”
\-Wayne making fun of Wax’s age[61]


The group traveled by carriage to the small town of Dulsing, which has been turned into a huge construction site for some huge project. The area was well guarded, and Wayne has Wax Push him by his belt beyond the guarded border. Wayne used his healing to recover, then knocked out the power for the floodlights. Marasi, MeLaan, and Wax snuck in, and Wayne and Wax went to find Mr. Suit and Telsin.
Wayne and Wax found Telsin in a guarded room, and Wayne distracted the guards so that Wax could rescue her. The guards spotted them, and a massive firefight broke out. Swarms of soldiers and kill squads attacked, knowing not to stop firing at Wayne even when he feigned being down. Wax, Wayne, MeLaan, and Marasi fought back with difficulty, and eventually escaped into the massive ship at [[Allik\|Allik]]’s urging. They went into a secret compartment, and Allik gave them weight-storing medallions, which Wayne and the others filled with weight. At Allik’s instruction, Wax Pushed the small aircraft into the air. They escaped Dulsing, picking up Steris on their way out. They headed towards the [[Kelsier\|Sovereign]]’s temple, where the Set was going. On the ride there, Allik told them about himself, Southern [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]], the Sovereign, and the Bands.

#### The Sovereign’s Temple
 by  Maria Dimova 
They flew over Edwarn’s expedition, Wayne inadvertently alerting them by kicking a pack overboard when Telsin bumped into him. They arrived at the temple, finding the crashed wreckage of another South Scadrian ship. They found a statue of the Sovereign, who was holding a spear with a spearhead that they assumed to be aluminum. Wayne stole the spearhead, which unbeknownst to any of them, was the Bands of Mourning. There were many booby traps in the temple, and MeLaan walked through them all, triggering them but remaining unharmed. Wayne stayed behind with Marasi and Steris, and soon Edwarn came forward with a flag of parley.
With Edwarn claiming to know how to open the locked door at the end of the temple and Edwarn having the small group outnumbered, they were at an impasse. Wax brought Edwarn and the others to the door, which Edwarn helped Wax open. Inside there was an empty pedestal, with broken glass but no Bands. Telsin betrayed them, attacking along with Edwarn. They used an allomantic grenade and wiped Wayne and Marasi’s allomantic reserves, and Wax was shot badly. With Edwarn and Telsin having allomantic powers granted through [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgy]] and the element of surprise, Wayne and the others were outmatched. Wayne escaped the room, though the others were captured.

>“*No. No. I can’t do this without you.*”
\-Wayne to Wax as Wax began to die[66]

Wayne fell into a pit filled with spikes, but healed. He found Wax in a cave, who was trapped under a huge piece of rock. Wayne fought Edwarn, who fled. Wayne tried to free Wax but couldn’t, and wept as Wax died. After Telsin took MeLaan’s spikes, turning her into a [[Mistwraith\|mistwraith]], Wayne found her and shot her in the face with Wax’s shotgun. He knew her gold metalminds would heal her. He retrieved both MeLaan’s spikes and ReLuur’s spike. He then used MeLaan’s spikes to restore her to consciousness.
Wax took the Bands of Mourning from Marasi, who had already used them partially, and defeated Edwarn, though Telsin escaped. After negotiating a deal with [[Jordis\|Jordis]] and her people, Wayne rode back to Elendel with the others on the airship. He talked with Wax about shooting Telsin, and they soon arrived back at Elendel.
In the following years, Wayne honed his skill with bendalloy, granting him more control over his speed bubbles. He was able to do so due to becoming very wealthy from a series of high-risk investments, especially in [[Tarcsel Electric\|Tarcsel Electric]].

### Investigating the Set
Six years after the recovering of the Bands, Wayne and Marasi attacked and subdued a group of criminals in Elendel, organized by the Set. Having honed his Allomantic skills over the past several years, Wayne was able to take out most of the criminals himself, while Marasi handled their leader.

>“*I'm sorry, Wayne, I need to leave you. Today. It's over. I tried to prepare you for this... but it was probably more painful to string it out, wasn't it?*”
\-MeLaan breaking up with Wayne[70]

Shortly after, MeLaan met with Wayne, and broke up with him. She wanted to say goodbye before leaving to explore the cosmere, and complimented him as "the best lay" she'd ever had. Wayne was emotionally crushed afterwards, and tried to drown his sorrows with liquor. He also met with members of [[Call and Son and Daughters Accounting and Estate\|Call and Son and Daughters Accounting and Estate]] to discuss his finances, though he was reluctant to do so. Due to the encouragement of Ranette, Wayne arranged for the bank to handle his future money deliveries to Allriandre.
Marasi planned a raid on a Set warehouse in Bilming, and Wayne, [[VenDell\|VenDell]], and a force of constables went with her. Wayne and VenDell impersonated members of the Set upon their arrival, and things went smoothly. However, the plan was ruined when the Bilming constabulary attacked the warehouse in a raid. As chaos broke out and the fighting began, Wayne fought a Set member named [[Getruda\|Getruda]], who was made to be a rough copy of him in both powers and mannerisms. Wax arrived and the fighting ended soon after, though Getruda escaped. The group was taken into custody, but was allowed to operate in the city if accompanied by a Bilming constable. The "constable" was [[Moonlight\|Moonlight]], who Marasi knew but Wayne didn't. The three investigated [[Tobal Copper\|Tobal Copper]], a man they knew to be involved with the Set's attempts to split harmonium to make a bomb. They went to Tobal's apartment, where Wayne analyzed the room. He deduced that the Set killed Tobal to keep him quiet, but cleaned up the mess well. He concluded that they all should go to a disreputable broadsheet office whom he might've told about the Set's actions. They found the broadsheet office that Tobal went to, and discovered that he told the proprietor, [[Maraga Dulcet\|Maraga Dulcet]], everything. They learned that the Set was trying to make a self propelled rocket to deliver a bomb to Elendel. Telsin arrived, and Wax distracted her while everyone slipped away. Afterwards, Wax and Wayne went to search Entrone's office, with Wayne providing a distraction. They explored an underground passage under Entrone's manor, and ran into [[Dumad\|Dumad]] and Getruda, the two Set agents. Wayne and Wax managed to defeat them, though Wayne lost a lot of his stored healing in the process.

>“*So I guess I'm beginnin' to wonder: Maybe I can't ever do enough good to balance the bad I done. Maybe I'll always be worthless.*”
\-Wayne to Wax[22]

They arrived at the Set's laboratory too late as a convoy of trucks left. Wax chased them, but they destroyed most their important documents by the time Wax caught up with them. Wax found some old-fashioned Roughs beer, and him and Wayne took some time to drink and relax atop a billboard. They talked about Wayne's past, and Wax tried to convince Wayne that he's a good person.

### Stopping the Bomb
>“*You don't hafta do this, mate. To hell with what you said you'd do. To hell with it all. You're in the wrong spot, and you know it. There's a door to your right. I don't know where it goes, but at least it ain't in here.*”
\-Wayne convincing the guards to flee[79]


Wax figured out that the Set would be launching the bomb soon from the highest building in Bilming, the Shaw (named for being reminiscent of the spires of [[Kredik Shaw\|Kredik Shaw]]). The two fought their way up the tower, with Wax taking out most of the Set soldiers guarding the bomb. When they got to the top, Wayne convinced the last group of guards to put down their weapons and flee, rather than being killed. He reasoned that they were simply working, frightened, security guards who were unaware of the activities the Set were up to, rather than the committed Set soldiers Wax and he had just wiped out. They came across their doubles, Dumad and Getruda, and fought them one last time. Instead of fighting their own doubles, they decided to fight each other's. Wayne was able to stay close to Dumad by grappling him, and getting Dumad to take them into the sky using a duralumin-enhanced Steelpush. He swiped the aluminum flask Dumad used to replenish his metals after using duralumin burned them away, denying Dumad the ability to Steelpush, causing them to fall a great distance, killing Dumad. Despite the satisfaction of defeating Dumad, Wayne was disappointed that they had fallen too fast for Wayne to say the witty remark he had come up with. They discovered that the bomb atop the Shaw is a decoy, and that the real bomb is on a ship, already en route to Elendel.
Wayne and Wax recovered hemalurgic spikes from the corpses of Dumad and Getruda and spiked themselves with them, giving Wayne the powers of a Coinshot, and allowing Wax to use duralumin and steel to fly them out to the ship where the bomb was. They cleared out the ship of enemies, but discovered that they couldn't disarm the bomb without it going off. Wayne figured out a way to lessen the explosion using bendalloy and steel. Harmony spoke to him, and told him it could work. Knowing his plan wouldn't need Wax, Wayne used a Steelpush to send Wax flying off the ship. Wayne ingested a small bit of lerasium, originally given to Wax by Harmony, and goes down into the ship's hold to where the bomb is, which was composed of three barrel devices with explosives.

>“*Hold on to your robes, my dear friend. This is going to be unlike anything you have ever seen before, I think.*”
\-Wayne to Harmony[6]

Harmony told Wayne that messing with one barrel would cause the others to immediately go off. Before forming his speed bubble, Wayne pulled out and consumed every bit of bendalloy he had on his person - a total of *seventeen* pouches; an amount which astounded even Harmony. At Harmony's command, Wayne created a perfect speed bubble.

 by  Diego López 
He enclosed all three barrel devices, but excluded the device that coordinated the bombs' explosions. He burned duralumin and bendalloy at the same time, compressing time immensely within the bubble. One by one, he filled all three barrels with water and Pushed them outside the bubble, detonating the ettmetal inside. The bubble dropped, and Wayne was killed by the explosion.

### After His Death
>“*Me, I saved the whole damn world. I... I'm probably the best constable who ever rusting lived!*”
\-Wayne to Harmony[4]


After his death, Wayne briefly spoke with Harmony before passing into the [[Beyond\|Beyond]]. He rejoiced in his victory, happy to have saved the world. He asked Harmony if he made the biggest explosion that a person ever made, which Harmony confirms as correct. Satisfied, Wayne passed into the Beyond. Wayne had various things put in his will, which were carried out after his death. He granted a large sum of money to both Ranette and Allriandre, left his lucky hat to Marasi, and arranged for a variety of random objects to be discreetly delivered to Wax over time (one example of this is a stuffed frog being delivered to Wax two years after Wayne’s death). Two years after his death, a bronze statue was made of him and placed in the Field of Rebirth to honor his memory.

## Relationships
 by  Gerard Segura 
### Waxillium Ladrian
>“*You’re a bizarre pair, you know.*”
\-Marasi to Wax[39]


[[Wax\|Wax]] is Wayne’s best friend and partner. Wayne acts as Wax’s deputy. They have an easygoing relationship, and they often engage in banter. Wax was the one who saved Wayne when he was about to be hung for murder, for which Wayne owes Wax a debt of gratitude. They have gone on countless adventures together, and have formed a strong friendship and trust. Though Wax laughs at most of Wayne’s jokes, he also wishes Wayne would not meddle in his personal life, such as disparaging [[Steris\|Steris]]. Wayne and Wax have a cheerful competitiveness to them, sometimes counting how many enemies they each defeated in a fight.

### MeLaan
>“*Maybe there was actually something there between them. If anything, Wayne didn’t seem the least bit put out by being reminded just how alien, and just how old, MeLaan was.*”
\-Wax[57]


Wayne has a very close relationship with [[MeLaan\|MeLaan]], and is attracted to her easy-going manner and free spirit. MeLaan admires Wayne’s skill with accents, and Wayne gives her pointers from time to time. Over time they grow quite close, and Wayne seems not the least bit perturbed about having a romantic relationship with her, despite her immense age and her being a Kandra. Their relationship becomes apparent when [[Wax\|Wax]] finds them making out in a luggage compartment. Wayne’s romantic inclinations towards MeLaan are what causes him to break off his pursuit of [[Ranette\|Ranette]]. When [[Telsin\|Telsin]] takes MeLaan’s spikes, turning her into a [[Mistwraith\|mistwraith]], Wayne manages to shoot Telsin, recover the spikes, and save MeLaan. Several years later, MeLaan breaks up with Wayne, stating that she had a mission from Harmony, and that if she stayed behind it wouldn’t be because she wanted to, but because she didn’t want to hurt Wayne.

### Marasi Colms
>“*You’re important. You help out a lot! Plus, you smell nice, and not all bloody n’ stuff.*”
\-Wayne[21]


At first, Wayne has no understanding of personal boundaries around [[Marasi\|Marasi]]. He often harasses her, and makes rude or inappropriate comments about her in her presence. Marasi is embarrassed easily by any romantic or sexual topic, which encourages Wayne, who makes her the target of several jokes. After a time, Wayne eventually becomes a better friend to Marasi, and their relationship improves. Despite his joking manner, he is still able to have several meaningful conversations with Marasi, and offers encouragement to Marasi amidst her self-doubt. Marasi occasionally confides in Wayne, such as asking about being in Wax’s shadow. Even so, Marasi occasionally has to reign Wayne in a little when they work together, often acting as the voice of reason.

### Ranette
>“*Nah. She’s just angry. That’s how she shows affection.*”
\-Wayne[39]


Wayne often flirts with [[Ranette\|Ranette]], but is continually met with hostility or indifference. Wayne doesn’t seem to care about how much he annoys Ranette, and often calls her "honey" or "darling". Ranette despises Wayne, and has shot him on four separate occasions. Wayne eventually tells Ranette he is no longer interested in her, a decision largely impacted by a conversation with Marasi and his developing relationship with [[MeLaan\|MeLaan]], and Ranette is grateful and relieved at the news.
