>“* The enemy makes another push toward Feverstone Keep. I wish we knew what it was that had them so interested in that area. Could they be intent on capturing Rall Elorim?*”

## Appearance
Feverstone Keep is a single-walled fortress made of red stone in a rift on the leeward side of a rock formation. The keep's battlement is a sheer wall facing an open plane of stone. The inside of the wall has a set of switchback stairs going down to the rift floor. Along the bottom of the wall are platforms and slits for archers to fire at an approaching enemy. The keep has a sally port that leads into a courtyard; there are main gates as well as some side gates.
The buildings inside the keep are built next to one another along the natural walls of the rift. The only decoration the buildings have are raincatchers on the roofs, as they are designed to be practical. The archways in the wall are of late classical style architecture.

## Location
Although the exact location of Feverstone Keep is unknown, it is somewhere near [[Rall Elorim\|Rall Elorim]], the capital of [[Iri\|Iri]].

## History
Feverstone Keep was a fallback position near one of the front lines during the False Desolation. The [[Singer\|singers]] connected to [[Ba-Ado-Mishram\|Ba-Ado-Mishram]] were interested in the area, but the reason for their interest was not immediately clear. The Orders of [[Stonewards\|Stonewards]] and [[Windrunners\|Windrunners]] were among those fighting on the front lines.
During a battle, hundreds of [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] that had been engaged in combat nearby walked back to the keep. A scout sent out to meet them reported that they were friendly, but the men inside were confused as to why they would be coming to the keep. While wearing their Shardplate, the Radiants charged forward in a line. When they stopped just within bowshot, more Windrunners dropped from the sky to join them and all of the Radiants summoned their Shardblades. One man in a blue cape stepped forward, drove his Blade into the ground, removed his Plate, and turned to walk away. As he did so, the glow of the weapons began to fade. The other Knights followed his lead. After the former Radiants abandoned their oaths, unknown soldiers were visible in the distance, waiting for the Radiants to return from the keep.
The soldiers inside the keep who observed these events were initially shocked, but they soon came outside to examine the discarded weapons. Initially, some officers yelled for the Blades to be left alone. They were quickly overwhelmed, however, as men rushed to claim a weapon. It did not take long for the scramble to deteriorate into a fight, with men using their newly obtained Blades to kill other soldiers.

### Dalinar's Vision and Investigation
One of [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] [[Dalinar's visions\|visions]] was set in Feverstone Keep, showing the events there and their aftermath. Dalinar believed he was witnessing the [[Day of Recreance\|Day of Recreance]]. Within the vision, he attempted to get more information about what was happening, but was met with cryptic answers.
Outside of the vision, Dalinar was unsuccesful in finding any information about Feverstone Keep, as the name seemed to have been lost to history. He later brought others including [[Jasnah\|Jasnah]], [[Navani\|Navani]], and [[Yanagawn\|Yanagawn]] into the vision; Jasnah was able to narrow down the time frame to around two thousand years ago, but there were not enough geographical details to determine the keep's location. [[Shallan\|Shallan]] later thought about Feverstone Keep while reading the notes that [[Ialai Sadeas\|Ialai Sadeas]] had made while investigating the [[Ghostbloods\|Ghostbloods]]. Ialai mentioned several obscure terms, and Shallan wondered if they were also ancient places that had been forgotten.
Dalinar met a representation of [[Odium\|Odium]] for the first time while experiencing the vision of Feverstone Keep; Odium commented on the level of passion and emotion that was occurring.
