**Galladon's father** is an [[Elantrian\|Elantrian]] on [[Sel\|Sel]].
Galladon's father used to be a farmer in [[Duladel\|Duladel]], he moved to [[Elantris (city)\|Elantris]] soon after the [[Shaod\|Shaod]] took him. He wasn’t happy in this city however, and his homeland of Duladel never left his mind. He became a scholar soon after his transformation, studying farming and agriculture even though they were useless to him.
One morning he woke up to find his dying wife next to him, suffering from an unexpected sickness. He tried to heal her, but failed because he didn’t know the proper healing methods. Due to this event he became deeply depressed. When his [[Galladon\|son]] became old enough to live on his own, Galladon's father told him to move back to Duladel and become a farmer. Shortly after this event he began feeling the signs of heart failure, however instead of going to the healers he simply waited. He eventually died about a year later.
