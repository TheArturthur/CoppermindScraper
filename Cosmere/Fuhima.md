**Fuhima** is a city in [[Nagadan\|Nagadan]] on [[Komashi\|Komashi]]. When [[Nikaro\|Nikaro]] saved a child in [[Kilahito\|Kilahito]] from a nearly-stable [[Nightmare\|nightmare]], the boy's father shared that his parents lived in Fuhima. As the city was distant enough from Kilahito that a nightmare could not track someone that far, Nikaro encouraged the family to go there to escape the nightmare.
