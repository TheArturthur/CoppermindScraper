## Appearance and Personality
Little is known of Bethab's appearance, other than the fact that he is [[Lighteyes\|lighteyed]]. His house colors are unknown.
[[Jasnah\|Jasnah]] considers him to be a dullard. In fact, one of his smartest moves was marrying [[Mishinah Bethab\|Mishinah]] for her political acumen. He lets his wife handle most important matters, rather than dealing with them himself. Bethab and Mishinah have a somewhat devious streak, as they have tried on several occasions to sneak language into contracts with the king that would give them favored claim in a succession. However, they know better than to try any trickery when [[Navani\|Navani]] is around.

## Attributes and Abilities
Although his princedom contains the sizable city of [[Karanak\|Karanak]] and appears to have an advantageous location where the [[Deathbend River\|Deathbend River]] empties into [[Mevan Bay\|Mevan Bay]], Bethab was not considered a major political player among the highprinces during the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]]. He is not well-respected, even among his own army, because he usually sends his wife to represent him at important meetings and functions.
Bethab does not maintain a well-organized army, instead preferring to use mercenaries. He shows little regard for the mercenaries, and often leaves the battlefield as soon as a [[Gemheart\|gemheart]] is captured, making no effort to lead his army back to the warcamps. He owns a large number of [[Chull\|chulls]].

## History
### Shattered Plains
Like the other highprinces, Bethab lived in his warcamp on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] during the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]]. His warcamp was located to the east of the palace, between [[Hatham\|Hatham]] and [[Sebarial\|Sebarial's]] camps.
House Bethab was not closely aligned with [[House Kholin\|House Kholin]], although they were more uncooperative than openly antagonistic. When [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] wanted to ally with a highprince for a joint plateau assault, Bethab unsurprisingly turned him down by letting his wife give the refusal. He later relented and joined Dalinar on at least one successful plateau run, and also participated in a joint run with [[Thanadal\|Thanadal]].
He attended the feast at the [[Pinnacle\|Pinnacle]] after [[Dalinar's visions\|Dalinar's visions]] became public knowledge.

### Urithiru
Bethab moved to the tower city of [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] after the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]]. Bethab appreciated Dalinar's leadership and eventually allied with House Kholin, although he continued to let his wife handle most matters.
By the time [[Jasnah\|Jasnah]] became Queen of Alethkar, Bethab had fallen into line with most of the other highprinces. He and Mishinah went to [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]] to serve as ambassadors there. Bethab proved useful, though not as much as his wife.
