## Characteristics & Attributes
The God Metals are metals formed directly from a [[Shard\|Shard]] and can be made from any Shard. Creating a God Metal without a Shard is extremely difficult, but possible. They can be alloyed with the lesser metals to form sixteen different metals each, though few are known. They can also be alloyed with each other. Besides having an [[Allomancy\|Allomantic]], a [[Feruchemy\|Feruchemical]], and a [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgic]] property, each God Metal can also do something else. The existence of God Metals is one reason why metal is so weird in the cosmere.
A Mistborn could burn any God Metal, though doing so may require a [[Connection\|Connection]] to the metal's Shard. Some God Metals can be used by anyone.
When measured by a  while being heated, [[Trellium\|trellium]] appears to emit a full spectrum of light at the same intensity as if it is a pure white color, except in the red frequencies where the readings jump above the maximum. [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]] notes that this is a physical impossibility and [[Harmonium\|harmonium]] is the only other time he has seen anything similar, suggesting that it is an identifiable trait of God Metals. It is unknown what determines the color where the reading will spike for an individual God Metal, and whether hybrid metals have one spike or several. This bears some resemblance to the impossible rainbows that form when the light given off by one of the Rosharan Lights is split by a prism.
If a Shard is [[Splinter\|Splintered]], God Metals that existed before will remain unaffected. Change of Shard's Vessel may over time cause properties of its God Metal to change. As name of the God Metal is usually derived by adding suffix "-ium" to the Vessel's name, people might start calling the metal by a new name to reflect the new Vessel.
God metals have interactions of some kind with both [[Fabrial\|fabrials]] and [[Aether spores\|Aether spores]], just like normal metals.

## Known God Metals
### Lerasium

Lerasium is the God Metal corresponding to the Shard [[Preservation\|Preservation]]. A normal person burning lerasium becomes a [[Allomancy\|Mistborn]] of undiluted power. A Misting or Mistborn burning lerasium drastically increases their powers. [[Feruchemist\|Feruchemists]] can use lerasium to store an unknown quality, and when used as a [[Hemalurgic\|Hemalurgic]] spike, lerasium steals all abilities.
Alloys of lerasium grant the user the powers of the associated metal, so that if an individual burned a lerasium tin alloy they would become a [[Tineye\|Tineye]]. If alloyed with other God Metals, such as [[Bavadinium\|bavadinium]], it is theoretically possible for the combined effect to grant abilities from the associated Invested Art.

### Atium

Atium is the God Metal corresponding to the Shard [[Ruin\|Ruin]]. An Allomancer burning atium is able to see a few seconds into the future. Feruchemists can use atium to store youth, and when used as a Hemalurgic spike, atium can steal the power to use any Invested Art.


#### Malatium

Malatium is an alloy of atium and [[Gold\|gold]]. An Allomancer burning malatium is able to see either who another person was in the past, or who they could have become if they had made different choices.

### Harmonium

Harmonium is the God Metal corresponding to the Shard [[Harmony\|Harmony]]. Called "ettmetal" in their native tongue, the Southern Scadrians use it to power their technology. Harmonium burns "with a pure whiteness" when used in Southern Scadrian machinery, and explodes when it is exposed to water (similar to the ) making it dangerous if not impossible to ingest for Allomantic purposes. Unlike alkali metal reactions, this reaction does not yield a "harmonium oxide," but it will yield "something else relevant to the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]]." Harmonium's atomic structure is that of a single element, rather than a compound or alloy.

### Raysium

Raysium is the God Metal of [[Odium\|Odium]]. Raysium can naturally conduct Investiture.

### Trellium

Trellium, also known as **bavadinium**, is the God Metal of [[Autonomy\|Autonomy]]. It is a silvery metal with a red cast to it, and dark red spots similar to rust. Its Allomantic and Feruchemical properties are unknown. It can be used Hemalurgically to steal some, if not all, Allomantic and/or Feruchemical abilities and grant them to [[Kandra\|Kandra]]. It can also be used on humans to create Hemalurgic constructs. Kandra and Hemalurgic constructs with a single spike of trellium will be hidden from Harmony. Trellium naturally repels Investiture, including other God Metals.

### Shardblades and Shardplate
[[Shardblade\|Shardblades]] and [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]] are both made out of a mixture of the unnamed God Metals of [[Honor\|Honor]] and [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]]. The precise proportion of the two differs depending on the type of [[Spren\|spren]] that forms the Blade, or the order to which the Plate belongs; as such, there are at least ten alloys. Like all God Metals, they are Allomantically viable, and thus burnable by a [[Allomancy\|Mistborn]], although it's yet to be seen what the effects would be. Presumably, they would also have Hemalurgic and Feruchemical effects.

### Honorblades

Honorblades are made out of the God Metal of Honor.

### The Dor
The [[Dor\|Dor]] is the remnant of [[Devotion\|Devotion]] and [[Dominion\|Dominion's]] combined powers after the Shards themselves were Splintered. There is a God Metal that comes from the Dor.

## Anti-God Metals
Physical matter is known to have a counterpart called  - matter composed of antiparticles that share many properties with the particles of ordinary matter, but manifest some of them in an opposite way (e.g. a proton and an antiproton have the same mass, but opposite electric charges and magnetic moments). Raboniel describes this in terms of axi with opposite polarities. A similar relationship exists between Investiture and anti-Investiture in the cosmere.
An Allomancer ingesting anti-God Metals will die.

## Trivia
Striking a chime or bell made of a God Metal would not necessarily produce a similar note to that God Metal's corresponding Tone.
Brandon has indicated that the atium present in [[Mistborn Era 1\|Mistborn Era 1]] is actually an alloy of atium and [[Electrum\|electrum]].
Where God Metals fit on the Periodic Table is planned to be covered in [[Mistborn Era 3\|Mistborn Era 3]].
