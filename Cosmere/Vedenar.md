## Etymology
It is unclear how the city got it’s name exactly, but during the [[Heraldic Epochs\|Heraldic Epochs]] it was called *Veden city*. It is likely that this name simply evolved into a different form: Vedenar.

## Geography and Layout
Vedenar lies on the southern edge of [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]], on the cliffs facing [[Tarat Sea\|Tarat Sea]]. The sound of the waves crashing against the stone can be heard across the entire city. To the west of Vedenar flows an unnamed river stemming from the [[Horneater Peaks\|Horneater Peaks]], while to the north lay the vast fields that feed its populace. Vedenar's ancient center is laid out in the shape of a hexagon, with its main thoroughfares forming a rotationally symmetrical pattern that was likely created through [[Cymatics\|cymatics]]. It's likely that the city has grown beyond that since the [[Heraldic Epochs\|Heraldic Epochs]].
Vedenar is known for its lush atmosphere and many amazing gardens. Most of the city is overgrown with greenery, with rare plants jumbled together wherever there's any space for them to grow. The most magnificent gardens sit atop vast, plate-like terraces that jut out above the city.
Unfortunately, following the Veden civil war, swathes of the city have been destroyed. Many buildings and terrace gardens have been reduced to heaps of rubble by siege equipment, while others have burned down to cinders. The destruction is uneven -- many Veden live in houses that remain well-preserved even as the neighboring buildings lay razed to the ground. Even months after the war's conclusion, the smell of smoke still lingers in the air.

### Notable Locations





## History
Vedenar is one of the [[Dawncity\|Dawncities]], the oldest settlements in all of [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. Back during the [[Heraldic Epochs\|Heraldic Epochs]], it lay in the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdom]] of [[Valhav\|Valhav]], and, having an [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]], was presumably its capital.
In the late [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]], Vedenar was well-known worldwide as one of the greatest cities on the planet. However, the [[Diagram (group)\|Diagram]] sought to destabilize the country so as to give [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]] an opening to take it over. For this reason, they sent [[Szeth\|Szeth]] to Vedenar to assassinate king [[Hanavanar\|Hanavanar]], his son and the highprinces, plunging Jah Keved into civil war.
The forces led by highprince [[Valam\|Valam]] took over Vedenar. The other highprinces soon followed after him, and the city fell into a months-long siege later termed the Battle of Vedenar. The siege was excessively brutal, owing to the Veden soldiers being pushed forward by the [[Thrill\|Thrill]] into combat past all reason. Many forces continued fighting even after suffering over fifty percent losses. In one battle, one of the armies pushed another off the city's cliffs and onto the ridge that protected the port from the highstorms.
The civil war eventually wound down, with Valam emerging victorious. However, he was extremely ill, and it was at this time that Taravangian arrived, bringing medical supplies and food. As he had a claim to the throne through his mother, Valam passed the crown onto Taravangian before sealing his own death, ordering his bastard son, [[Redin\|Redin]], to kill him.
After being crowned, Taravangian set out to improve the living conditions in Vedenar. The bodies of the fallen were collected and burned down in the fields outside the walls. The soldiers were folded under Taravangian's command and moved into the stormshelters within the city. After [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] reached out to the king, [[Malata\|Malata]] opened the local [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]], reconnecting Vedenar with [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]]. Some of the [[Alethi\|Alethi]] troops were stationed there to aid in defending and rebuilding the city.
It was while visiting Vedenar that Dalinar was pronounced a heretic and excommunicated from the [[Vorin\|Vorin]] church. Later, after it was revealed that rather than Vedenar, the [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]] sought to attack [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]], some of the Alethi battalions there were withdrawn, but a number remained in case of a surprise attack. It is likely that after Jah Keved joined Odium, Vedenar also switched sides, and that Voidbringer forces rule the city, if only in some small ways.

## Politics and Economy
#### Capital
Vedenar is the capital of [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]]. This means that large parts of the Veden government, as well as the monarch and their family, reside here. As the political center of Jah Keved, most of the highprinces spend their time in Vedenar rather than in their own lands. Various lesser nobles, such as [[Lin Davar\|Lin Davar]], also visit it quite often. [[Redin\|Redin]] works from there as an investigator for highprince Valam.
Whoever controls Vedenar, controls Jah Keved -- it is for this reason that during the civil war, all the Veden highprinces brought their armies here. The Battle of Vedenar was the most bloody conflict of the civil war largely becase every faction knew the city's value.
Vedenar was also the capital city of the [[Silver Kingdom\|Silver Kingdom]] of [[Valhav\|Valhav]]. This means that it was one of only ten cities to have an oathgate. Even during this time, Vedenar was one of Roshar’s most important cities.

#### Economy and trade
Vedenar is also very important economically, It is an important sea port connecting the country with other states along the shore. The city is also important as a transport hub. When active, its Oathgate allows it access to ten other locations across Roshar, including [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]]. Its large size and good connections make it a perfect place to disappear in.
