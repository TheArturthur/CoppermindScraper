## History
[[David Charleston\|David Charleston]] and [[Abraham Desjardins\|Abraham Desjardins]] were inspected by Neon and group of his henchmen who were searching Ildithia for [[Larcener\|Larcener]] on Limelight's behalf. He was frustrated when the  was taking longer than usual to scan David but, since he was a minor epic and had to answer to Limelight, he held himself back and did not do anything to harm him. After the machine gave its response Neon told David to leave and then went to inspect the nearby buildings to see what might have caused the delayed reading. David saw this reading as confirmation that [[Regalia\|Regalia]]'s claims that she had made him into an Epic were unfounded.
