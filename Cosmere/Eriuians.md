The **Ériuians** are a people on the [[Earth (Frugal Wizard)\|alternate medieval Earth]]. [[Sefawynn\|Sefawynn]] says that [[Friag\|Friag's]] binding of [[Fenris\|Fenris]] saved the Ériuians, along with the rest of the world's peoples, though they were not aware of the battle.

## Trivia
The Ériuians are presumably this alternate dimension's version of the Irish. In the real world, Ériu is the Old Irish name for Ireland.
