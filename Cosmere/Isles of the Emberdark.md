## Development
Brandon initially stated that he has no plans to write a sequel to *[[Sixth of the Dusk\|Sixth of the Dusk]]*, but later came up with an idea he liked that involved [[Sixth of the Dusk (character)\|Dusk]] going into the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]] and wrote an outline and the first chapter for that story. He is hesitant about writing more and releasing the novella, however, because it would have extensive spoilers for the space age of the cosmere. At the virtual release party for *[[Rhythm of War\|Rhythm of War]]*, he read an excerpt from what he had already written; a transcript of the reading can be found .
Brandon struggled to get the storyline going for several years, until he added Starling and her narrative to the story, which allowed his writing to gain momentum and the story to take shape.

## Plot Summary
In the draft read at the *Rhythm of War* release party, the story takes place about six years after the events of *Sixth of the Dusk*. The [[Ones Above\|Ones Above]] are starting to grow impatient and want to build an installation to breed and collect [[Aviar\|Aviar]] on one of [[First of the Sun\|First of the Sun's]] islands. [[Vathi\|Vathi]] and [[Dusk\|Dusk]] are trying to figure out how to delay their progress and are also dealing with people from another world, likely [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. Dusk realizes that the people of First of the Sun are hopelessly outmatched and decides to go through [[Patji's Eye\|Patji's Eye]], the [[Perpendicularity\|perpendicularity]] on the [[Patji (island)\|island Patji]], to try to enlist help.
In the second narrative, Starling, a Yolish Dragon, is exiled from Yolen twelve years before the events of the story, and eventually becomes lieutenant of a ship that flies in the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]], which is owned by [[Xisis\|Xisis]].

## Synopsis
*All his life, Sixth of the Dusk has been a traditional trapper of Aviar—the supernatural birds his people bond with—on the deadly island of Patji. Then one fateful night he propels his people into a race to modernize before they can be conquered by the Ones Above, invaders from the stars who want to exploit the Aviar.*
*But it’s a race they’re losing, and Dusk fears his people will lose themselves in the effort. When a chance comes to sail into the expanse of the emberdark beyond a mystical portal, Dusk sets off to find his people’s salvation with only a canoe, his birds, and all the grit and canniness of a Patji trapper.*
*Elsewhere in the emberdark is a young dragon chained in human form: Starling of the starship *Dynamic*. She and her ragtag crew of exiles are deep in debt and on the brink of losing their freedom. So when she finds an ancient map to a hidden portal between the emberdark and the physical realm, she seizes the chance at a lucrative discovery.*
*These unlikely allies might just be the solution to each other’s crisis. In their search for independence, Dusk and Starling face perilous bargains, poisonous politics, and the destructive echo of a dead god.*
*Sanderson expands his thrilling novella “Sixth of the Dusk” into a mythic novel of legends, lore, and warring galactic superpowers.*
