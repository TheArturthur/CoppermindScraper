>“*What of you? Your engagement is the talk of the city!*”
\-Steris to Lord Stenet[1]


**Lord Stenet** is a patron of [[Lady ZoBell's party\|Lady ZoBell's party]] in [[Elendel\|Elendel]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
He approached [[Wax\|Wax]] and [[Steris\|Steris]] and asked them how their wedding plans were going. Wax expected him to eventually get around to asking about textile tariffs, but Steris successfully distracted him by asking after his own engagement. As he had been cheating on his partner, Lord Stenet was discomfited enough by the question to excuse himself quickly and leave.
