**Mount KraeDa** is a mountain in the center of [[Dayside\|Dayside]] on [[Taldain\|Taldain]]. It lies in the middle of the [[Kerla\|Kerla]], a desert region north of [[Lossand\|Lossand]].
The [[Diem\|Diem]] holds contests and ceremonies in a secluded location near the base of KraeDa. The duration of the [[Mastrell's Path\|Mastrell's Path]] is determined by the length of time that it takes for the moon to cross behind the mountain (approximately one hour in Dayside timekeeping).
