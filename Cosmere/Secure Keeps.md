The **Secure Keeps** is a [[Thaylen\|Thaylen]] bank vault in the [[Ringington market\|Ringington market]] of [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. It has its name written in both Thaylen and the [[Women's script\|women's script]] across the top of the front face.
It was abandoned by the bank, likely prior to the [[Siege of Kholinar\|Siege of Kholinar]], and then was occupied by [[Velalant\|Velalant]] to use as a distribution point for food and supplies during the siege. [[Shallan\|Veil]] observed the distribution while she was in the market trying to get a feel for the city. She noticed that it was badly organized and actively excluded those who needed the grain in favor of giving it to servants from [[Lighteyed\|lighteyed]] households. While surveilling, she met [[Grund\|Grund]], who told her about the failures of Velalant's charity.
