**Noseball** is a sport on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
In [[Bilming\|Bilming]], noseball was banned by Mayor [[Gave Entrone\|Gave Entrone]] in 348 [[Catacendre\|PC]]. However, the local constables did not enforce the new law; this may be because some of them played the sport themselves. In [[Elendel\|Elendel]], local leagues passed out flyers in a bid to recruit players. [[Wayne\|Wayne]] invested some of his funds in creating a city-wide league complete with a dedicated stadium. He requested that his accountants change the sport's name and some of the rules, but it is unclear if that stipulation was acted on or not.
