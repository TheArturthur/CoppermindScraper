## Appearance and Personality
Thomos is slightly heavyset and has pale skin, brown eyes, a dimpled chin, and a gap in his teeth. Like other Canticlites, he wears gloves on his hands to prevent accidental heat transference. Thomos shows grit and determination in the face of danger and is willing to help others even in perilous situations.

## History
Thomos is taken captive by the [[Cinder King\|Cinder King's]] forces after an assault on Beacon. He is forced to watch his fellow prisoners be left for the sun and is present when Nomad first arrives on Canticle, witnessing Nomad surviving in the planet's sunlight.
He is later lead into Union's arena along with approximately thirty other prisoners and forced to survive capture by several [[Charred\|Charred]]. Thomos helps Nomad climb on top of one of the arena's metal boxes and asks something about Nomad killing, referencing Nomad's weapon. Nomad replies that he cannot understand and the two watch the arena from the top of the obstacle. As the contest winds down, Thomos climbs down from the box.
Though he survives the contest in the area, Thomos' success and stamina leads the Cinder King to decide to turn him into a Charred. The Cinder King holds up the spear to convert him, making a spectacle of the event for the cheering crowd while Thomos screams and struggles against his captors. Though Nomad attempts to harden himself and ignore it, Thomos' cries break through and prompt Nomad to take action and call [[Auxiliary\|Auxiliary]] as a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]]. Stunned by the display, Thomos is given a brief reprieve by the Cinder King until the Beaconites arrive and begin their rescue mission.
When the fighting begins, the Charred that are holding him throw him away and kick him in the face. Thomos falls off the Cinder King's ship almost getting buried by the muddy ground near the center of the arena and breaking his leg. Nomad grabs Thomos' arm, rips him from the soil, and throws him over his shoulder. Nomad carries the injured Thomos across the arena and tosses him onto the back left seat of Rebeke's [[Hovercycle\|quadcycle]]. Thomos is overcome with emotion and tearfully thanks Nomad for rescuing him. As they fly away in the cycle, Nomad expands Auxiliary as a shield to cover himself and Rebeke who is piloting the craft hoping that they will be enough of a distraction to direct focus away from the exposed Thomos in the back seat.
The hovercycle is pursued as it leaves Union and Thomos fearfully clings to his seat with wide eyes and hair fluttering in the wind. Eventually, Thomos begins to list in his seat and lose consciousness from pain. However, he regains enough lucidity to watch Nomad defeat and scare off the pursuing Charred, evoking awe.
Once back at Beacon, Rebeke informs [[Zeal\|Zeal]] and [[Adonalsium-Will-Remember-Our-Plight-Eventually\|Adonalsium-Will-Remember-Our-Plight-Eventually]] that Thomos had been rescued and asks them to inform Thomos' family. Thomos begins losing consciousness again, muttering deliriously that Nomad had survived the sunlight and Zeal orders several Beaconites to take him away for medical attention.

## Trivia
Nomad tells Auxiliary that the only reason he decided to save Thomos from the arena is because he reminded him of an old friend. This old friend is most likely [[Hobber\|Hobber]] given the similar description, especially the gap-toothed smile.
