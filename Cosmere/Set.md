## History
### Origins
The Set was the result of a domino effect stemming from [[Kelsier\|Kelsier's]] actions. At some point a number of semi-cosmere-aware individuals discovered the existence of [[Shard\|ancient gods]], went looking for them, and ended up finding/being found by Autonomy. The leaders of the Set were not aware of Autonomy's true nature and intentions, knowing her as the male Trell and interacting with her through Trell's "Faceless Immortals". At some point, Autonomy decided that [[Scadrial\|Scadrial's]] advancing technological development would be detrimental to her own goals.
[[Telsin Ladrian\|Telsin Ladrian]] eventually discovered the existence of the Set and joined it (in a manner very similar to how the Set found Autonomy), later recruiting [[Edwarn Ladrian\|Edwarn Ladrian]]. They eventually rose to the ranks of Sequence and Suit, respectively.

### The Vanishers
Edwarn Ladrian faked his death to enter the Set. He provided funding for [[Miles Dagouter\|Miles Dagouter]] and the [[Vanishers\|Vanishers]]. The Vanishers were instructed to kidnap female descendants of the [[Spook\|Lord Mistborn]] in order to breed more [[Misting\|Mistings]] for some unknown purpose. The Vanishers did this through a series of elaborate, and seemingly supernatural, train robberies. [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]] discovered that his uncle lived after capturing Miles. During Wax's encounter with his uncle, Wax stole Edwarn's pocketbook that contained appointments and notes.

### The Bands of Mourning
Wax was provided with information from the [[Kandra\|kandra]] that the Set was operating in the city of [[New Seran\|New Seran]], and that his sister [[Telsin\|Telsin]] was observed there. While Wax and company traveled to New Seran they were attacked in a Set train robbery. Professor [[Irich\|Irich]] was present. When they arrived in New Seran Wax and [[Steris\|Steris]] attended a ball at the home of a local noble Lady [[Kelesina Shores\|Kelesina Shores]]. Wax learned about Set activities near [[Dulsing\|Dulsing]]. When he confronted Lady Shores she was communicating with Suit through a strange metal box. Lady Shores was killed by a servant and discovered to be wearing a [[Gold\|gold]] [[Metalmind\|metalmind]] that was not keyed to an individual. The goldmind had a large amount of health stored in it and [[Wayne\|Wayne]] was able to tap it.
The party then traveled to Dulsing, where a Set compound had been built around the entire town. They infiltrated the compound and discovered what appeared to be a large boat in the center. The boat was actually the *Brunstell*, a [[Southern Scadrian\|Southern Scadrian]] airship. Wax was able to rescue Telsin. [[Marasi\|Marasi]] and [[MeLaan\|MeLaan]] discovered and rescued a Southern Scadrian named [[Allik\|Allik]] who had been held captive in the offices of Professor Irich. They escaped the compound in the *Wilg*, an outrigger from the main airship.
From there they attempted to get to the [[Sovereign's temple\|Sovereign's temple]] to secure the [[Bands of Mourning\|Bands of Mourning]] before a Set expedition could. They arrived at the Temple first and the Set arrived shortly after. Suit used threats and was able to accompany Wax into the Temple. Wax and company were then betrayed by Telsin who was revealed to hold the Set rank of Sequence, a higher rank than Suit. Suit and Sequence were also revealed to have [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgic]] Spikes, granting themselves three [[Metallic Arts\|Metallic Arts]] abilities each.
The search for the Bands appeared to be lost. The Set was interested in the Bands of Mourning, but their primary objective was to secure the Hunter airship, and its bombs, that were abandoned at the temple. Upon first entering the Temple [[Wayne\|Wayne]] took the spear tip from a statue of the [[Sovereign\|Sovereign]]. He had put the spear tip in Marasi's bag. She discovered that it was in fact the Bands of Mourning. She was able to rescue Wax, who then used the Bands to confront Suit on the departing airship. He apprehended Suit and recovered the airship. The Set members were imprisoned and the airship was returned to the surviving Southern Scadrians. Sequence escaped from the Temple in the *Wilg*.

### Accelerated Timeline
>“* The Set had been planning for events a century or more away.*”
\- Mister Suit[14]


The Set had evidently planned for its goals to be reached a century in the future. With the discovery of the Bands of Mourning, Southern Scadrians, and their technology, the timeline was accelerated. While held in an Elendel jail, Suit was visited by a mysterious creature with red eyes. He told Suit that the Set had decided that allowing civilization on Scadrial to continue was too dangerous and that they decided to "remove life on this sphere instead." The creature then activated an explosive device, killing Suit.
Before Autonomy could attack Scadrial, Telsin somehow managed to convince Autonomy to give the Set a chance to take over the planet again. Autonomy, ever appreciative of bold, ambitious actions, responded by Investing Telsin as her avatar. However, she also granted Telsin a deadline before which the world would have to find itself under Set's control, as on a specific date, the artificial [[Perpendicularity\|perpendicularity]] she was creating to let her armies in would be opened.

### Bilming
Over the six years following the death of Edwarn, the Set fully took control of the city of [[Bilming\|Bilming]] on behalf of Autonomy, up to developing it with accordance to Autonomy's philosophy and using Taldain architecture. At the same time, they conducted underground tests in order to create a [[Trellium\|trellium]]-[[Harmonium\|harmonium]] bomb. The key part of the plan -- and the part of it meant to impress Autonomy -- was the delivery device: a self-propelled rocket, something that Autonomy herself was yet to figure out.
While in Bilming, Wax and his team, as well as a group of [[Ghostbloods\|Ghostbloods]], began to unravel Set's plan. Later that day, when Wax confronted Telsin, Harmony briefly disrupted Autonomy's link to her, causing Telsin to fall unconscious. When Telsin came to, Autonomy abandoned her willingly, having apparently given up on her and her plans. After Wax and Wayne destroyed the Set's bomb, while Marasi destroyed the perpendicularity intended for the [[Men of gold and red\|men of gold and red]], Autonomy begrudgingly withdrew from Scadrial, acknowledging their victory.

## Organization
The Set is an organization with a strict hierarchy among their ranks, codenames are used to indicate where one is in this hierarchy. The highest rank among them is 'The Key' who serves as the organization's leader. Each rank within the set must immediately report to the rank above them, serving at their direct orders, despite this rigidity however [[Autonomy\|Autonomy]] encourages its members to be bold and thus it is common for those on the bottom rungs to try and climb up the organization. The lowest ranked members, Cycles, are those in charge of local hired muscle, this muscle is granted no rank themselves.
The ranks within the set are:

The Key
Series
Sequence
Suit
Cycle
## Known Members of the set
For more information, see :Category: Set.
Though the Set have many accomplices, there appear to be a smaller group of ranked leaders. The members that control the Set are known as the "Series."

### The Key

### Cycles

[[Granks\|Granks]] was a "Cycle".
### Unknown Rank

[[Fed\|Fed]] is a [[Iron\|Skimmer]] [[Ferring\|ferring]] of an unknown rank.
[[Getruda\|Getruda]] is of an unknown rank, presumably a Sequence like Dumad.
