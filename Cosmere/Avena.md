**Avena** is a historical scholar on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. She presumably lived during the [[Heraldic Epochs\|Heraldic Epochs]]. She is mentioned in *[[Words of Radiance (in-world)\|Words of Radiance]]*, and may have been consulted about unusual events that were occurring ahead of the [[Recreance\|Recreance]].

>“*Now, as the [[Windrunners\|Windrunners]] were thus engaged, arose the event which has hitherto been referenced: namely, that discovery of some wicked thing of eminence, though whether it be some rogueries among the Radiants' adherents or of some external origin, Avena would not suggest.*”
