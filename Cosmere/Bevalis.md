## Geography
Bevalis is located in a mountain valley, somewhere in the Idrian mountains. It is several weeks away from the southern farms, sometimes called the lower farms.
Bevalis is located in a cold climate, with only a brief time in the summer being warm.

## Appearance
Bevalis contains a number of thatched cottages. These houses have sturdy whitewashed stone walls. It’s roads are unpaved and muddy.

>“*Women chasing runaway geese, men pulling donkeys laden with spring seed, and children leading sheep on their way to pasture.*”
\-Siri describing Bevalis[1]

Bevalis contains only a few thousand people, barely making it a village when compared to the metropolises in other nations. Due to this the city is rather quiet.

### Royal palace
As the capital of [[Idris\|Idris]] Bevalis contains the royal palace. This palace serves as a meeting place and center of operations for the kingdom. The palace also serves as the living quarters of the Idrian Royal Family.
The royal palace is a large, single storied building. It’s walls are squat and the palace has a peaked wooden roof. The Palace has two known entrances, the front entrance, and the back entrance, which leads to the palace kitchens. The palace also contains the royal stables, which are connected to a large courtyard of packed dirt. This courtyard has a gate leading to the outside.
There are often large crowds of haggling people near the front entrance. The palace also employs multiple stableboys and cooks. The palace is large enough to almost be considered flamboyant, although this can be forgiven as it functions as a meeting hall. 

## History
Bevalis was established at an unknown date. Sometime during the next three hundred years the Idrian Royal Family decided to make it their capital.
A little over three hundred years after the [[Manywar\|Manywar]] General [[Yarda\|Yarda]] visited Bevalis carrying a bright pink letter. This letter said that the Idrians were expected to send a princess to [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]] to be married to the [[God King\|God King]].
A short time after this King [[Dedelin\|Dedelin]] decided to send his youngest daughter, [[Sisirinah\|Sisirinah]], to Hallandren. With her he sent a number of soldiers, a steward and a few serving boys, as well as the kingdom’s nicest carriage.
