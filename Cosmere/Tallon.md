## Trivia
In the original *[[White Sand\|White Sand]]* maps, Tallon was a nation on the south eastern coast of Dayside while Nor'Tallon was a separate nation north of Tallon, with its western border comprised of the southern end of the mountain range, and deep sand. However, an updated map in the *White Sand* omnibus edition merged Nor'Tallon into Tallon, with the former expressly defined as Tallon's capital city in the glossary.
