\-Endowment on Ambition's Vessel[1]


**Ambition** is a [[Shard\|Shard of Adonalsium]]. The Vessel of Ambition was [[Uli Da\|Uli Da]], but she was killed shortly after the [[Shattering\|Shattering]]. She at one point visited the [[Threnody\|Threnodite]] system.
It is uncertain whether or not Ambition once had a system of [[Investiture\|Investiture]] associated with her.

## History
The Shard Ambition was created when [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]] was Shattered by a group of people on [[Yolen\|Yolen]]. Uli Da took up Ambition and Ascended; she then made her way to the [[Threnodite\|Threnodite]] system.
Shortly after the Shattering, the Shard [[Odium\|Odium]] arrived in the system. Odium desired to be the sole remaining Shard in the Cosmere and considered Ambition to be a dangerous rival; as a result, he had them as number one on his list of Shards to eliminate. Ambition, Odium, and [[Mercy\|Mercy]] fought one another in the space between the planets, struggling in all three [[Realmatic Theory\|Realms]]. Odium gained the upper hand and mortally wounded Ambition by tearing off chunks of her power, which altered the people of Threnody as well as the planets in the system. Ambition managed to escape the system, but she was killed and [[Splinter\|Splintered]] in another location despite fighting back. This left a wound on the Spiritual Realm and affected Threnody in "disturbing" ways, as well as having far reaching effects elsewhere in the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]].

## Influence
The Shard Ambition may have had a local manifestation of Investiture at one point in its past. [[Nazh\|Nazh]] gave [[Khriss\|Khriss]] records from the [[Homeland\|Homeland]], which indicate that there used to be some sort of Investiture present on the planet prior to Ambition and Odium's fight. On the other hand, this Investiture may have existed prior to the arrival of both Shards. It is unknown if this Investiture is still in existence or not after Ambition fled the system.
There are several other notable sources of Investiture on Threnody that may be associated wholly or in part with Ambition. There appears to be excess Investiture in general, which infuses the spirits of some humans. The spirit of these people imprints upon this power, and when the person dies, the power remains behind in the form of a [[Shade\|shade]], a [[Cognitive shadow\|Cognitive shadow]] with a low level of consciousness. In addition to the shades, the [[Evil\|Evil]] is also present on Threnody. This force of darkness destroyed an entire continent, sending people fleeing from the Homeland and other regions of the [[Fallen World\|Fallen World]] to the [[Forests of Hell\|Forests of Hell]] for safety. Khriss indicates that she believes that this may be the product of a chunk of Ambition's power, twisting the people and the planet itself. There is no stable [[Perpendicularity\|perpendicularity]] on Threnody, although there are some unpredictable and unstable perpendicularities that are of morbid but unknown origin.
It is unknown what, if any, impact Ambition's power may have had on the planets Monody and Elegy.
Endowment believes that they are better off for Ambition being dead.

## Trivia
Ambition would be mono black in *Magic: the Gathering*.
While technically fulfilling the requirement of not being on a planet, Ambition is not the Shard Brandon was thinking of when discussing a Shard that did not inhabit a planet.
