## Synopsis
*Three years ago, [[Lift\|Lift]] asked a goddess to stop her from growing older–a wish she believed was granted. Now, in *Edgedancer*, the barely teenage nascent [[Knight Radiant\|Knight Radiant]] finds that time stands still for no one. Although the [[Yanagawn\|young Azish emperor]] granted her safe haven from an executioner she knows only as [[Nale\|Darkness]], court life is suffocating the free-spirited Lift, who can’t help heading to [[Yeddaw\|Yeddaw]] when she hears the relentless Darkness is there hunting people like her with budding powers. The downtrodden in Yeddaw have no champion, and Lift knows she must seize this awesome responsibility.*

## Summary
For a chapter by chapter summary, see [[Edgedancer (novella)/Summary\|/Summary]].
Lift travels with her spren [[Wyndle\|Wyndle]] to [[Yeddaw\|Yeddaw]] in [[Tashikk\|Tashikk]] from [[Azimir\|Azimir]] where her friend [[Gawx\|Gawx]] had recently been crowned emperor. Upon arriving at the city, she makes sure to display her [[Order of Edgedancers\|Edgedancer]] powers to the guards so that she can find [[Nale\|Darkness]]. She hopes to find and protect another [[Knights Radiant\|Radiant]] that she knows he's hunting in the city. She also has the goal of eating all ten varieties of pancakes that they make during the [[Weeping\|Weeping]].
She finds an [[Tashi's Light Orphanage\|orphanage]] in order to get some food. It's run by an old lady referred to as the [[Stump\|Stump]] and haunted by a strange old philosopher. The Stump is cranky and cynical because many children come to her who have some sort of mental illness, and after they have been with her for a while, they are healed. She feels like she's constantly being scammed.
Lift finds the city guard from earlier and follows her to her abode, hoping that Darkness will show up. He does the next day, and after she makes her report about the slippery, glowing girl, Lift follows Darkness to his home and spies on him and his initiates. They plan to execute the other Radiant that very night. Darkness vows to take care of Lift himself.
Lift figures the best way to find the other Radiant first is to find someone doing something "strange" in the city, so she goes to the [[Grand Indicium\|Grand Indicium]], the repository for all writings in the city, and demands an investigation. At first the scribes are dismissive of her demands, but Gawx vouches for her via [[Spanreed\|spanreed]] and commands them to do what she says. After a long day of fruitless research, an emergency is declared because of the coming [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]]. Lift finds Darkness' minions in the Indicium and tries to tail them, but they fly away. [[Szeth\|Szeth]] has stayed behind and describes where they're going: it's obviously the orphanage. She thinks the old philosopher is the one they're after, so she hurries off to try to stop them.
When she arrives, the two minions are dead and the "old man" is actually an [[Dysian Aimian\|Dysian Aimian]], whose body is made up of specially shaped cremlings. Lift realizes that the Stump is the Radiant because she's been healing the children. She rushes into the orphanage and barely avoids being killed by Darkness, but he does mortally wound the Stump, tempting Lift to come heal her like she did for Gawx. Instead she goes to the roof and shows Darkness the Everstorm, convincing him that the [[Desolation\|Desolation]] has come. He flies off and Lift rushes back to heal the Stump.
Lift starts her journey back to [[Azir\|Azir]]. She feels like she will be needed there.

## Postscript
Lift is one of [[Brandon Sanderson\|Brandon's]] favorite characters in the [[Stormlight Archive\|Stormlight Archive]] and will have a larger role in the series in future books. This novella accomplishes two things: 1) shows the progression of Lift through her oaths, and 2) shows how [[Nale\|Nale]] changes his mind about killing off the Radiants.
The fact that Lift still thinks she is ten years old, even though she has lived for thirteen years, is more than just a joke.

## Development
The first draft of *Edgedancer* was written during May 2016.
