>“*[I] went to check on him a couple times, like you asked. You'll find him three streets west of the Fourwell Crossroads.*”
\-Dockson to Kelsier on Camon[1]


**Fourwell Crossroads** is an intersection in [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. Its name comes from its four wells, one in each of its corners. It also has a copper fountain in its center, which depicts the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]] with the [[Deepness\|Deepness]] defeated and lying at his feet.
Many people pass though Fourwell Crossroads, which makes it a popular spot for beggars to set up, though they have to fight to maintain their place there. After [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] had him made a beggar, [[Camon\|Camon]] did not get a spot at Fourwell Crossroads, and had to set up at a smaller and less popular square three streets to the west.
