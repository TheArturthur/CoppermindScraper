**Soonie pups** are a stuffed toy found in [[Elendel\|Elendel]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. They are manufactured by Soonie Industries and are meant to represent [[TenSoon\|TenSoon]] as a [[Terris\|Terris]] .
They have real fur and legs that can move. [[The House Record\|The House Record]] advertises them as selling for seventy-five clips each, or one-[[Boxing\|Boxing]]-fifty for two.

## History
[[Sazed\|Sazed]] included TenSoon in the [[Words of Founding\|Words of Founding]], making him a well-known part of the legends around the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]]. TenSoon was annoyed by the mention, and further annoyed by the subsequent commercialization of Soonie pups.
[[Wax\|Wax]] heard of the toys, and referred to them as "Soonie cubs." His son, [[Maxillium Ladrian\|Maxillium Ladrian]], later owned a Soonie pup that he named "Tenny" and enjoyed playing with.
[[Olin Tober\|Olin Tober]], a professor at [[Elendel University\|Elendel University]], wrote repeatedly to Soonie Industries and *The Two Seasons* claiming that Soonie pups were a historically inaccurate representation, since Terris wolfhounds did not exist pre-Catacendre, and the [[Kandra\|kandra]] would therefore actually have taken the form of a wolf dog. He released a historically accurate Soonie pup, which sold for a fivespin with a trade-in of the other kind of Soonie pup, and sponsored [[Nicki Savage\|Nicki Savage's]] broadsheet column with it. His version included a patented zippered pocket, presumably inspired by the ability of kandra to store items within their bodies.
