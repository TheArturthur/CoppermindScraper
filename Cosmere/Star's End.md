## Plot
According to Brandon, it was about a team of scientists on a space station trying to absorb the energy from a supernova, inspired by his interest in the topic. There was also a murder mystery on the station.

## Repurposed Elements
The character of [[Kazan Smedry\|Kaz Smedry]] originated in *Star's End*. There is also a being that is conceptually similar to what we now know as [[Spren\|spren]]. The [[Sleepless\|Sleepless]] were also conceived for the novel.

## Future
Brandon has revisited *Star's End* and calls it "not good" or even "terrible", and well below the quality of other early works. However, it represents one of the first times that he felt like his writing showed real potential.
There are no plans to revise the book into something that could be published. It could be released in a future [[Dragonsteel Entertainment\|Dragonsteel]] Kickstarter as part of the [[Sanderson Curiosities\|Sanderson Curiosities]] series, but it would be towards the bottom of the list.
