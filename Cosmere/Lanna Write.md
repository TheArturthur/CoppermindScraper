## Appearance & Personality
Jason and Lanna have a working relationship that, while very efficient, is very heavy on teasing each other. She frequently refers to him as, "Old Man," to his consternation. In return he complains quite convincingly whenever she is assigned as his support, despite the fact that he is actually the one who does the assigning. Despite always telling Jason that his outlook on the human race's situation was too idealistic, she always wanted to believe that he was right after all.
She has red hair.

## History
### Denise Investigation (2211)
Lanna was assigned as Jason's Base Support Operative during his investigation of the case of a missing PC scientist named [[Denise Carlson\|Denise Carlson]].

### Death & Legacy
After Lanna died, Jason created an AI based on her memories and personality. Learning that AIs could develop emotions in the [[Nowhere\|Nowhere]], he brought her orb in, in hope to bring sapience to the Lanna-AI. After Jason's death, the recently turned sapient AI returned to the Nowhere, where - unable to cope with Jason's death - she replicated herself thousands of times to create the hive-mind of [[Delver\|Delvers]]; beings opposed to change and greatly despising anything outside of the Nowhere.
