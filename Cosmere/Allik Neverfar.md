## Appearance and Personality
 
For more images, see [[Allik Neverfar/Gallery\|/Gallery]].
Allik is twenty two, and has a short wispy beard and moustache, which make him look younger. Like all [[Malwish\|Malwish]], he wears a red and black mask over his face at all times.
Allik seems to be a bit of a free spirit, and is not afraid to say whatever happens to come to his mind. He is the most comfortable of the *Brunstell*’s crew in interacting with the Northern Scadrians, and doesn’t seem as put off by their maskless state as the rest of the Southerners.
Allik subscribes to the customs of his people in his dealings with Allomancers, although the titles he uses for Wax, such as "O Great Impetuous One" and "Unobservant Master" are not always the most respectful.

## Attributes and Abilities
 
>“*You have to be something more special than that, if you want to fly. We're expected to be gentlemen and ladies. We’ve thrown people overboard for not knowing the proper dance moves.*”
\-Allik to Marasi[5]


Allik does not possess any [[Allomantic\|Allomantic]] or [[Feruchemical\|Feruchemical]] abilities, but he is able to use the [[Metallic Arts\|Metallic Arts]] through the [[Unsealed metalminds\|medallions]] his people produce. He displays an extensive knowledge of some Metallic Arts, as he is able to tell with just a glance what Wax’s abilities are. However, he seems to be less familiar with temporal Allomancy, as he does not initially realize that [[Marasi\|Marasi]] and [[Wayne\|Wayne]] are Allomancers.
Allik's dancing is not good enough to impress his captain, despite his efforts rescuing her and the crew.

## History
  Trapped in the cage
Allik grew up on the south pole of [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]], as part of the Malwish nation in a town named [[Wiestlow\|Wiestlow]]. He flew north on the airship *Brunstell* under Captain [[Jordis\|Jordis]] as a pilot for the shuttle *[[Wilg\|Wilg]]*. After the *Brunstell* was downed in the [[Seran Range\|Seran Range]], Allik was captured by the Set along with the rest of the crew.
When [[Wax\|Wax's]] team infiltrated the Set’s base outside of [[New Seran\|New Seran]], [[Marasi\|Marasi]] and [[MeLaan\|MeLaan]] discovered Allik in a cage, and freed him from his imprisonment. Discovering the remains of some of his crewmates, Allik then helped them escape the Set by piloting the Wilg and led them to the [[Sovereign\|Sovereign's]] Temple to seek the legendary [[Bands of Mourning\|Bands of Mourning]], which his crew had originally gone searching for. Allik entered the temple alongside the others, and was greatly surprised at Melaan's lack of care approaching the various traps. He traveled through the temple, past the traps after Melaan triggered them. Allik was taken captive by the Set alongside Marasi and Steris, where he almost died in the freezing cold due to the Set taking his heating medallion off of him. When Marasi used the spear head that was the Bands of Mourning to fight the Set, Steris gave Allik a medallion she had hidden inside a notebook, saving him from the cold. He managed to grab hold of more medallions, and give them to the rest of the surviving Southern Scadrian crew, freeing them and helping defeat the Set. Allik returned with his fellows back to his homeland, after gifting Marasi his old, cracked mask.

## Relationships
### Marasi
Marasi finds Allik in a cage, captured by the Set alongside his companions, and is the one to release him. She consoles Allik after he discovers the gruesome sight where the Set tortured his fellow crewmates. Allik gives Marasi his mask before the *Brunstell* departs [[Elendel\|Elendel]], leading Wayne to remark that Allik might have a crush on Marasi.

### Wax
Due to the fact that he was raised to revere [[Metalborn\|Metalborn]] Allik treats Wax with reverence. Wax finds this annoying and often tells Allik to stop.
