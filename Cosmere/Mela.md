**Mela** is a [[Windrunner\|Windrunner]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Attributes and Abilities
As a Windrunner, Mela is able to heal herself with [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]] and to use the [[Surge\|Surges]] of [[Gravitation\|Gravitation]] and [[Adhesion\|Adhesion]]. She is competent at fighting with a spear.

## History
Mela was part of the force of [[Windrunner\|Windrunners]] that went to [[Emul\|Emul]] as part of the [[Coalition of monarchs\|coalition's]] army. She accompanied [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]], [[Szeth\|Szeth]], [[Sigzil\|Sigzil]], [[Lyn\|Lyn]], [[Leyten\|Leyten]], and another Windrunner to [[Tukar\|Tukar]] to meet with [[Ishar\|Ishar]]. When Ishar drew his [[Honorblade\|Honorblade]] on Dalinar, the five Windrunners fought him. Ishar, however, a master duelist, managed to [[Connection\|Connect]] each of them to the ground and drain away their [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]]. Szeth countered Ishar's tactics by severing his Connections and collapsing Dalinar's [[Perpendicularity\|perpendicularity]] with [[Nightblood\|Nightblood]], and Dalinar and the Windrunners Lashed themselves into the air.

\-To Dalinar[1]

After Szeth and Nightblood prompted Ishar to retreat into [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]], the group returned to the ground and looked through Ishar's pavilion. They were perplexed by the strange corpses they found; after Mela called Dalinar over to a body, the [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]] recognized it as a [[Cryptic\|Cryptic]] and realized that all of the corpses were [[Spren\|spren]] in bodies that should not be possible in the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]]. The group grabbed whatever they could find in the tent that looked to be of use and quickly retreated to Emul.
