## Origin
The fools represent the antitheses of the [[Immortal Words\|ideals]] of the ten [[Herald\|Heralds]]. The number of fools stems from the nature of [[Honor\|Honor]]. Each fool corresponds to a specific Herald, although people on Roshar are not aware of the relationship between the two groups. Unlike the Heralds, it is not known if the ten fools are based on historical individuals.

## Cultural Use
The ten fools are invoked to describe someone who is acting very foolish. Each fool is known for a specific foolish attribute that has a representative [[Glyph\|glyph]] known to Vorin [[Ardent\|ardents]]. Specific fools are often referenced in order to emphasize that particular foolish trait, either using their name or their number (the fools have a specific numerical order, e.g. the "fourth fool"). The ten fools are mentioned only by residents of Vorin nations, and it is unclear if they are known in other parts of Roshar.
[[Pai\|Pai]] invokes the ten fools in a bold protest against Queen [[Aesudan Kholin\|Aesudan Kholin]] and the [[Alethi\|Alethi]] government, and is executed for her actions.

## Known Fools

## Quotes

>“*... I've made a life out of traveling to difficult places to trade, and even my babsk said that trying to trade with the Horneaters was akin to the seventh fool.*”
\-Rysn[12]
