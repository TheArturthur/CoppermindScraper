**Curnips** are a type of [[Rockbud\|rockbud]] native to [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. They are cultivated as a vegetable. It is unclear if they are related to [[Lurnip\|lurnips]], another edible plant on Roshar.
While experiencing a [[Visions\|vision]] of the [[Heraldic Epochs\|Heraldic Epochs]], [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] identifies some plants as curnips; this implies that they are still cultivated on Roshar during the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]], possibly in Dalinar's home nation of [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]].

## Trivia
Some versions of *The Way of Kings* refer to this plant as a turnip, but this was later corrected; "curnip" is used in the leatherbound edition.
