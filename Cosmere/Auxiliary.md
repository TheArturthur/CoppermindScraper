## Personality
Auxiliary's personality before the Dawnshard killed him is unknown. After the Dawnshard burned away most of his essence, parts of his personality were burned away as well. Because of this he is always talking in the same monotone voice . He is self conscious about this, and often gives a description of what tone he would've used when speaking.
While his death was caused by Nomad, Auxiliary doesn't truly blame him for it, instead blaming it on the Dawnshard. Auxiliary views himself as the Knight, and Nomad as his squire.

## Attributes and Abilities
Although Auxiliary is a highspren, there are a number of differences between him and ordinary spren. This is because a Dawnshard burned away most of his essence.
Due to this, Auxiliary doesn't seem to have a presence in the physical realm, unlike other Radiant spren. He is very aware of his surroundings however, often pointing things out to Nomad.
Auxiliary possesses a lot of knowledge about [[Investiture\|Investiture]] and [[Connection\|Connection]]. Despite this he is not very good at spotting anti-Investiture. He also has a very precise knowledge of how much Investiture Nomad has left.
Auxiliary is capable of manifesting as a weapon or tool, only limited by [[Nomad\|Nomad's]] imagination and understanding of what he wants to create.

## History
Sometime after Nomad, who was known as Sigzil at the time, bonded an honorspren, Auxiliary formed a bond with him. Nomad and Auxiliary likely met in Shadesmar. Nomad is known to have sworn the Fourth Ideal of the Skybreakers.
In a moment of need Nomad, carrying the Dawnshard, reached out for Investiture to protect himself, the Dawnshard found it in Auxiliary and started to use his essence to fuel Nomad's abilities. Nomad was barely able to stop before the Dawnshard burned away all of Auxiliary.
During Nomad's time on the run Auxiliary accompanied him.
At some point, Auxiliary took oaths and began considering himself a Knight Radiant.
