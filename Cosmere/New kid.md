This article's title is uncanonical and a fan created one, because an official term or name has not been made yet.
The **"new kid"** is an unidentified sailor who joined the crew of the *Wind's Pleasure* in Tanat 1173 when it stopped in [[Amydlatn\|Amydlatn]] in eastern [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. He was hired by Captain [[Tozbek\|Tozbek]] as an extra deckhand to make sure the ship was not undermanned on the trip to [[New Natanan\|New Natanan]].
He is six feet tall with a blunt face and a hulking frame, and he is extremely strong. [[Yalb\|Yalb]] calls him "new kid" even though he is at least five years Yalb's senior. Yalb tries to engage with him, telling him that the rest of the crew will like him if he does his dishwashing duties. However, he does not speak much, and Yalb thinks he is simpleminded.
He was presumably hired by [[Tyn\|Tyn]] and the [[Ghostbloods\|Ghostbloods]] and planted on the ship. He participated in the mutiny against Tozbek, including the execution of several crew members and the attempted assassination of [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]]. [[Shallan\|Shallan]] evaded him and some other thugs using Lightweaving. It is unclear if he survived the burning and sinking of the *Wind's Pleasure*.
