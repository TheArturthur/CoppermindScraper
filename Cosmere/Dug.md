\-Wayne[1]


**Dug** is a childhood friend of [[Wayne\|Wayne's]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. He and Wayne knew each other in [[Tinweight Settlement\|Tinweight Settlement]] when he was nine and Wayne eleven. Wayne thought Dug knew things, so he repeated to his mother Dug's assertion that people can legally drink at a tavern when they are twelve. Dug also described to Wayne the tough crimes Allomancer [[Jak\|Jak]] had recently solved and defined the term "bastard" as the kind of turd you get when you hold it in too long.
