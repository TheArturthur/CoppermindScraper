**Lanacin the Surefooted** is a historical figure on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
He is said to have killed a [[Shardbearer\|Shardbearer]] and won a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]]. He was presumably [[Alethi\|Alethi]], as there is a monument to Lanacin in southwest [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]].
[[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] knew of his story, and believed that the stories of men like Lanacin and [[Evod Markmaker\|Evod Markmaker]] indicated that opportunities for [[Darkeyes\|darkeyes]] had decreased over time in Alethkar.
Either Lanacin the Surefooted or [[Evod Markmaker\|Evod Markmaker]] actually poisoned a Shardbearer to obtain their Shards, although this isn't well known.
