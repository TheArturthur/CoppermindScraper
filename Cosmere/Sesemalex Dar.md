## Geography
The city of Sesemalex Dar sits on a stone plain on the west coast of Emul. It borders on [[Tukar\|Tukar]] and is northeast of [[Torriqqam\|Torriqqam]].
The design of Sesemalex Dar is intricate and often said to be spectacular, built in enormous gashes in the ground to protect it from [[Highstorm\|highstorms]]. Each trough has a lip of rock diverting water from flowing into the city and a complex drainage system of cracks to help it weather the storms, as well as stone of a unique composition that helps with the drainage. The pattern of the Sesemalex Dar is central to the Emuli religion. The structure of the city is very similar to [[Yeddaw\|Yeddaw]], and many consider visiting Yeddaw to be the closest thing to seeing Sesemalex Dar itself.

## History
Sesemalex Dar was founded at an unknown time. One of the most ancient cities in the world, some believed it to be a [[Dawncity\|Dawncity]]. The Emuli made the city their capital at some point, regarding its design as central to their religion. However, the Tukari also desired the city for its use as a port, and they were able to use the status of their ruler, [[Tezim\|Tezim]], as a justification for attempting to take it. This resulted in the [[Eighty's War\|Eighty's War]], a conflict centered around the city which lasted several years.
At the advent of the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], the Eighty's War was swallowed up by the conflict with [[Odium\|Odium's]] forces. The [[Fused\|Fused]] and [[Singers\|singers]] took the southern part of Emul, including Sesemalex Dar. The city was freed from this occupation when the [[Coalition of monarchs\|coalition of monarchs]] successfully regained control of Emul in 1175.

## Culture
It is said that the city of Sesemalex Dar--and the entire kingdom of Emul--was named by [[Jezrien\|Jezrien]] himself. Some people such as [[Au-nak\|Au-nak]] believe Sesemalex Dar to be a [[Dawncity\|Dawncity]]. The Emuli believe that Sesemalex Dar is their ancestral homeland given to them by the [[Heralds\|Heralds]] and often speak of its religious significance.
The citizens of Sesemalex Dar are well known for their marvelous [[Crem\|crem]] pottery, and the city itself is a major waypoint and trade city of the south. Due to the wealth of trade in Sesemalex Dar, the bordering nation of [[Tukar\|Tukar]] wants the city for its fantastic port; this is the conflict at the root of the [[Eighty's War\|Eighty's War]]. As such, the city has been a war zone for a long period of time.
