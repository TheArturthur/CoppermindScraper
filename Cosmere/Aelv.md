## Appearance and Anatomy
Unlike a [[Landswight\|landswight]], an aelv is visible to people of [[Earth (Frugal Wizard)\|Earth]]. They look like a regular human, though noted for appearing more feminine than a traditional man. They typically are clean-shaven, and are not overly muscular, with delicate facial features. Overall their appearance stands out as being more perfect than a regular person.

## Behavior
An unbound aelv is considered dangerous, needing to be appeased or bound to try stop them doing anything. They like to mock and play with mortals. They shy away from a [[Skop\|skop's]] boasts however, and can be bound by invoking their ancient name.

### Abilities
An aelv is able to control a person or overpower them.
