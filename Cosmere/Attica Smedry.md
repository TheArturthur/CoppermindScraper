## Appearance and Personality
Attica is described as being a tall man with hawkish features and messy dark brown hair. He usually wears an antiquated suit or dark robes. After his consciousness was transferred to the Incarnate lenses (The blood-forged lenses that help the user control the power of the Incarna), His appearance is now a set of slate-gray lensed glasses. Attica is charming and well-liked by the people of [[Nalhalla\|Nalhalla]].
His son [[Alcatraz Smedry\|Alcatraz]] describes him as a terrible father, and his father [[Leavenworth Smedry\|Leavenworth]] comments that he does not cope with fame too well. Attica himself admits to being terrible at saying goodbye. However, while he may not always pay attention to Alcatraz, he does love him, as proved when Alcatraz looks through the Shaper’s Lenses: he wants to be universally adored, but he also wants his family there with him. He also sacrifices his life for Alcatraz.
Attica's motives are always unknown, as he seems to be four steps ahead of everyone else. Even when his form became the Incarnate lenses, he seemed to have decided it was unavoidable, and in fact, critical for the world, so that the Incarnate energy could be released through the Worldspire. Nothing seemed to faze him, which is why he never seemed to care about Alcatraz. Ultimately, he wanted the best for everyone, and with his attention divided, he could never show enough of it to where it was most needed.

## Attributes and Abilities
Attica has the ability to lose things, which is a space talent on the [[Smedry Talent\|Incarnate Wheel]]. Though he is never seen using his Talent, he is stated to have great control over it. Attica is also a skilled [[Oculator\|Oculator]] and can use the different Oculator's [[Lens\|Lenses]].
Other than his magical abilities, Attica is a renowned scholar and researcher in the Free Kingdoms. His achievements include discovering how Transporter's Glass works and devising a method for collecting the Sands of Rashid. He is incredibly intelligent, as he found a loophole in the rules of the Library of Alexandria -- which allowed Alcatraz to free him from the library -- and was able to infiltrate the [[Highbrary\|Highbrary]].
Once he is moved to the Incarnate lenses, Attica could perceive the power of the Incarnate wheel, and with his research, was able to help Alcatraz spread the talents to all of humanity to effectively dilute it, though the power of the Smedry talents remained at their usual force.

## History
Attica married Shasta over the objections of his father, who believed Shasta was only manipulating him in order to gain his Talent. Together, they researched the origins of Smedry Talents and the [[Sands of Rashid\|Sands of Rashid]], which Attica managed to collect. Shortly after the birth of Alcatraz, Attica and Shasta separated, and Attica disappeared from the [[Free Kingdoms\|Free Kingdoms]].
Thirteen years later, Attica allowed himself to be captured in the [[Library of Alexandria\|Library of Alexandria]] and turned into a Curator. He left a message which allowed his son to free him. Before he was freed, he used his Curator status to gather knowledge about the [[Incarna\|Incarna]].
Upon returning to the Free Kingdoms, Attica spent a week alternately socializing with Free Kingdom nobility and feverishly recording knowledge gained from the Library of Alexandria. He then announced his intention to develop a way to give everyone Talents using the knowledge he gained during his imprisonment.
After this, he went to the [[Highbrary\|Highbrary]] to read its Forgotten Language books. He was eventually captured by Biblioden and sacrificed on the altar of outdated encyclopedias to create a Blood-forged Lens.
Once Biblioden is defeated, it is discovered that Attica's consciousness resides in the Incarnate lenses forged by his sacrifice, and is believed to be trapped in there for the remainder of his days, as he hasn't been freed by the time of Basille's writing of the book, most likely being finished not long after the marriage of Alcatraz and Bastille.
