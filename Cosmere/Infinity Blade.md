**Infinity Blade** is a mobile phone game. [[Brandon\|Brandon]] has written two short stories set in the universe:

Infinity Blade: Awakening - Released Oct 2011 alongside the iPhone 4S announcement
Infinity Blade: Redemption - Released Sept 2013

The game developers were introduced to Brandon through Isaac, one of the art developers, as they were in college together. They approached him with the idea to write some stories set in the world of their games and Brandon accepted, partially because they were friends and partially so that he could gain experience writing for video games. He helped them develop a narrative that is much clearer in the later games, as well as a protagonist in the name of Siris.
