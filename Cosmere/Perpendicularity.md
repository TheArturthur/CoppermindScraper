>“*At these points, Physical matter, Cognitive thought, and Spiritual essence become one--and a being can slide between Realms.*”
\-From Khriss's essay on the Drominad system[1]


A **perpendicularity** is a junction between the [[Physical Realm\|Physical]], [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive]], and [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual Realms]]. They are used by [[Worldhoppers\|worldhoppers]] such as [[Hoid\|Hoid]] to go from planet to planet. They are formed through the concentration of [[Investiture\|Investiture]]. Because of this, they are most commonly found at places where a Shard's power is focused, often in the form of a pool of liquid. A Shard can control where their perpendicularity manifests. A perpendicularity may manifest as the Shards color.

## Creation
Perpendicularities occur naturally when a [[Shard\|Shard]] spends lots of time on a world. Generally, leaving a planet would cause the Shard's perpendicularity to disappear. As a result, their presence is often used to indicate the presence of a Shard. Special circumstances, however, can prevent the perpendicularity from disappearing, and there is at least one Shard that fits these circumstances. [[Autonomy\|Autonomy]] is capable of creating perpendicularities unexpectedly across multiple planets in a way that goes against the laws of [[Realmatic Theory\|Realmatic Theory]] as it is currently understood by arcanists. It requires specific conditions.
Some perpendicularities can be forcibly closed by having people utilize the massive amount of Investiture coming from it. [[Nightblood\|Nightblood]] is able to collapse a perpendicularity.

## Mechanics
Perpendicularities are formed at locations with a large concentration of Investiture. The concentration of Investiture brings the three realms closer together and allows travel between them. Perpendicularities will not transport people between realms unless they want it to happen. They can be used to see into the Spiritual Realm. The proximity of the realms also makes [[Soulcasting\|Soulcasting]] easier.
[[Aluminum\|Aluminum]] can be used to take liquid from a perpendicularity, and it will stay Invested. Some perpendicularities are more Invested than others. The enormous concentration of Investiture in a perpendicularity makes it possible to become a Cognitive Shadow by entering one. In at least some circumstances, a perpendicularity's liquid Investiture may be unkeyed. Devices can be made to point towards a perpendicularity.

## Known Perpendicularities

**Ruin**: the pool below the [[Pits of Hathsin\|Pits of Hathsin]] was [[Ruin\|Ruin's]] perpendicularity; it was the main path used by inter-world traders before it was destroyed by [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]].
**Preservation**: [[Preservation\|Preservation's]] perpendicularity was the [[Well of Ascension\|Well of Ascension]]. It served as [[Ruin\|Ruin's]] prison, making it extremely dangerous.
**Harmony**: [[Harmony\|Harmony]] has a perpendicularity somewhere in the south, it is known to be under careful watch by the Malwish. An article in *[[The House Record\|The House Record]]* mentions a woman coming across a perfectly blue pool somewhere in the mountains in the Southern [[Roughs\|Roughs]], and a sudden appearance of a strange figure by the pool. It's possible, though not confirmed, that this could be Harmony's perpendicularity.
**Autonomy**: Autonomy briefly had a perpendicularity in [[Bilming\|Bilming]], that was since destroyed by [[Marasi Colms\|Marasi Colms]], [[Armal\|Armal]], and several other Allomancers.

**Devotion**: [[Devotion's Perpendicularity\|The Pool]] near [[Elantris (city)\|Elantris]] is [[Devotion\|Devotion's]] perpendicularity.
**Dominion**: There is a second perpendicularity on [[Sel\|Sel]], presumably of [[Dominion\|Dominion]].

[[Threnody\|Threnody]] does not have a stable perpendicularity, but rather a number of unstable, unpredictable ones of a morbid origin. They may possibly have something to do with the creation of [[Shade\|Shades]], although the fact that the Shard of [[Ambition\|Ambition]] has died near the system has far greater influence on their creation. It is more of a circumstance than a location.

[[First of the Sun\|First of the Sun]] is notable for having a perpendicularity, presumably [[Patji's Eye\|Patji's Eye]], without a Shard in residence. However, [[Patji (being)\|Patji]] is an avatar of [[Autonomy\|Autonomy]], which is likely the cause of the perpendicularity.

**Cultivation**: [[Cultivation's Perpendicularity\|Cultivation's Perpendicularity]] is located in the [[Horneater Peaks\|Horneater Peaks]], under the surface of one of the [[Horneater Oceans\|Horneater Oceans]]. For [[Worldhopper\|worldhoppers]] of Roshar, it's the main method of travelling between Roshar and its subastral, [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]]. Most recently, it has been besieged by the [[Fused\|Fused]].
**Honor**: [[Honor's Perpendicularity\|Honor's Perpendicularity]] is well-known among worldhoppers and [[Spren\|spren]] to be unstable and dangerous. The exact pattern of its appearance is uncertain, although [[Bondsmith\|Bondsmiths]] are able to open it. The perpendicularity closes on its own within a few minutes.
The [[Surge\|Surge]] of [[Transportation\|Transportation]] temporarily creates a miniature perpendicularity, allowing an [[Elsecaller\|Elsecaller]] or [[Willshaper\|Willshaper]] to travel into Shadesmar from anywhere. However, returning back to the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]] presents a far greater challenge, and can only be performed in some places. It is unclear if this allows travel to the Spiritual Realm.

**Endowment**: The location of [[Endowment\|Endowment's]] perpendicularity is unspecified. It is, however, located somewhere in the jungles of [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]]. The [[Tears of Edgli\|Tears of Edgli]] owe their existence and their unusual properties as dye material to soaking up the [[Investiture\|Investiture]] flowing up from the perpendicularity. There are enough cosmere-aware people on Nalthis for there to be customs at this perpendicularity, and it is used for trade.

There is something similar to a perpendicularity on [[Yolen\|Yolen]], despite the lack of a Shard.

**Autonomy**: Autonomy has an ability to create and collapse perpendicularities in a way that goes against the understanding of Arcanists. These have specific constraints and conditions in order to be produced. Despite the specific conditions, she is known to have created perpendicularities across multiple worlds across the cosmere.
**Silverlight**: [[Silverlight\|Silverlight]] has a perpendicularity known as the Silverlight Nexus.
