**Slink** is one of the eight members of [[Migs\|Migs']] gang in [[Elendel\|Elendel]].
He is captured in a raid on the gang's hideout, the morning of [[Wax\|Wax's]] wedding. After the constabulary unsuccessfully attempted to convince the gang to surrender, Wax stormed the old pub while [[Wayne\|Wayne]] disguised himself as a fellow gang member, knocking out several thugs, including Slink.
It is unknown whether Slink was executed for his crimes, though Waxillium advised the gang leader that those captured wouldn't be hung if he got his way.
