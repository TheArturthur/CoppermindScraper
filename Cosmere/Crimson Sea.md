This page or section needs to be updated with new informationÂ for *Tress of the Emerald Sea*!Be aware that in its current state, it may not include all additional content yet.

The **Crimson Sea** is an ocean on [[Lumar\|Lumar]]. It is sometimes nicknamed the domain of the [[Xisisrefliel\|dragon]].

## Geography
The Crimson Sea is notable for its unpredictable weather patterns, which makes it one of the most dangerous seas on Lumar. The reason for this danger is due to the fact that the navigation of the seas is based upon the predictability of weather on Lumar, and the Crimson Sea simplifies this down to pure luck. Therefore, ships avoid traveling through it, and the sea is mostly uninhabited.
It borders the [[Emerald Sea\|Emerald Sea]] and [[Midnight Sea\|Midnight Sea]], along with three other unnamed seas.
