The **dramascope** is a divinatory tool created by [[Izzy\|Izzy]] on [[Komashi\|Komashi]] which utilizes [[Hion viewer\|hion viewer]] dramas in a manner reminiscent of horoscopes. She believes that her idea will become very popular, and ultimately make her wealthy and famous, though she eventually abandons this idea with a goal of becoming a viewer critic.
When Izzy first meets [[Yumi\|Yumi]], she cross references the [[Yoki-hijo\|yoki-hijo's]] name and birthday with a list of episodes to determine that she will have good luck, and that it is a good day for making promises. Awareness of current events also seems to factor into one's dramascope. Izzy claims that her own dramascope says she will date an alien.
[[Nikaro\|Nikaro]] isn't sure how serious Izzy is about her dramascopes, because she occasionally seems to acknowledge that it sounds crazy.
