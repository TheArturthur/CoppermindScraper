## Appearance and Personality
 
For more images, see [[Chanarach/Gallery\|/Gallery]].
Chana was born on [[Ashyn\|Ashyn]], and left it for [[Roshar\|Roshar]] when the planet was razed by human [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]], making her likely of similar age to the other [[Herald\|Heralds]]. Vorin artwork tends to present her as a young woman. Vorin depictions also show her wearing blue armor and holding a straight sword with a bifurcated blade. Chana's [[Safehand\|safehand]] is not covered in these depictions, while other female Heralds do have their safehand covered.

## Attributes and Abilities
 
For the abilities all Heralds share, see [[/wiki/Herald#Abilities]].
As a [[Herald\|Herald]], Chanaranach is immortal and capable of returning from death, though at the cost of a Desolation. She was a capable fighter, and wielded an [[Honorblade\|Honorblade]] that made her a [[Surgebinder\|Surgebinder]], granting her the use of the [[Surge\|Surges]] of [[Division\|Division]] and [[Abrasion\|Abrasion]]. She has discarded her Blade, however, leaving her without Surgebinding.
Perhaps due to her power over Abrasion, Chanaranch is known for being incredibly fast, as [[Fleet\|Fleet]] beating her in a foot race is considered a noteworthy achievement.

## History
She would have lived in [[Shinovar\|Shinovar]] for a period, before humanity began to expand outward, inciting a war between the humans and the [[Singers\|singers]].
When humans and singers went to war, she and nine other people were made Heralds by [[Honor\|Honor]], forming the [[Oathpact\|Oathpact]]. Following every [[Desolation\|Desolation]], she would travel to [[Braize\|Braize]] and be tortured there until either she or one of the other Heralds broke, sending them back to Roshar and starting a new Desolation. This cycle went on for thousands of years, gradually wearing on her sanity, along with that of all the other Heralds.
At [[Aharietiam\|Aharietiam]], the Last Desolation, Chanarach, like the rest, abandoned the [[Oathpact\|Oathpact]], leaving her [[Honorblade\|Honorblade]] at the location of the final battle and departing for parts unknown. What happened to her afterwards is unknown, though she has been seen alive.

## Culture
 
In [[Vorinism\|Vorinism]], Chanarach is known under the symmetrical name **Chanaranach**, though the diminutive Chana is also used. **Chan-a-rach** is a far rarer spelling, only seen used in a song. She is associated with the number 3 (chach), the [[Ten Essences\|Essence]] Spark, and the divine attributes of Brave and Obedient. Her body focus is the soul. Phrases such as "Chana knows..." and "Chana help (somebody)" are common, and typically related to threat or protectiveness. The name [[Chanada\|Chanada]] is likely derived from Chana. And the name [[Chanasha\|Chanasha]] definitely is.
As with the other Heralds, there is a temple to her in every modern city. This tradition appears to go back to the [[Desolation\|Desolations]], as there was once a temple of Chanaranach in [[Stormseat\|Stormseat]].
She is thought of as the Herald of the Common Man. and is believed to be "fine and reputable".

## Trivia
Chanarach's portrait used in the chapter arches is called the Guard by the [[Dragonsteel Entertainment\|Dragonsteel Entertainment]] staff.
[[Brandon Sanderson\|Brandon]] has [[RAFO\|RAFO'd]] whether or not Chanarach is the assassin [[Liss\|Liss]], and [[Peter Ahlstrom\|Peter]] did the same for a question regarding [[Shallan's mother\|Shallan's mother]].
