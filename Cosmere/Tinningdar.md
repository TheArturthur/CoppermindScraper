## Description
The tinningdar's most distinctive feature is a colorful overlapping V pattern down the front. The pattern is embroidered. They are commonly worn with a belt and often have wide sleeves, which can help accommodate [[Metalmind\|metalmind]] bracers. Stewards may own multiple sets of tinningdar, including more ornate versions that they wear to formal events.

## History
  <<Sazed\|Sazed>> in a tinningdar
### Final Empire
In the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]], Terris stewards traditionally wear a tinningdar in the three colors of the noble house that the steward serves. They are sometimes referred to as "steward's robes"; [[Jastes\|Jastes]] identifies [[Sazed\|Sazed]] as a steward by his robes. Other items of Terris clothing, such as the robes worn by [[Tindwyl\|Tindwyl]], are colorful and identifiably Terris, but are not mentioned as having the distinctive V pattern of the tinningdar.
Sazed regularly wears the tinningdar, even when performing menial tasks, such as digging a grave or stirring soup. He sees the robes as part of Terris history despite the fact that they also represent the lifestyle forced upon the Terris by the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]]; he wonders if future Terrismen will continue to wear the tinningdar.
Sazed and other former stewards continue to wear the tinningdar after the fall of the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]], although the colors no longer represent nobility.

### Post-Catacendre
The tinningdar is still worn by the Terris 300 years after the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]]. Teenage Terris students, including a young [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]], wear them in [[The Village\|the Village]]. Wax does not find the robes comfortable.
Wax "dies" and meets [[Harmony\|Harmony]]—presumably in the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]]—and perceives his clothing as the tinningdar, with layers of time instead of color.
