>“*You know. Real darkeyes. Like us.*”
\-Khav's opinion of Kaladin[1]


**Khav** is a resident of [[Hearthstone\|Hearthstone]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
He has low eyebrows and a permanently scowling expression. He is a teenager in 1165, but younger than [[Jost\|Jost's]] 14.
[[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] uses his name as an example of a 'solid, Alethi darkeyes' name, unlike his own.
He was amongst the children, including [[Jost\|Jost]], [[Jest\|Jest]], [[Mord\|Mord]], [[Tift\|Tift]], and [[Naget\|Naget]], who Kaladin and [[Laral\|Laral]] approached one day and Kaladin asked if they should be worming. He doesn't believe Kaladin is a real darkeyes, nor does he agree that farmers and soldiers are equal professions.
