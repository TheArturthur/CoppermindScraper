**Kerzt** is an ancient historical figure on Taldain. Kerzt and his sister [[Lossa\|Lossa]] both claimed to have been visited by the [[Sand Lord\|Sand Lord]]. Lossa ended up gaining the powers of [[Sand mastery\|sand mastery]], while Kerzt did not.

## Appearance
Kerzt is traditionally depicted as a short man with a beard. He wears a hooded robe and carries a thin staff or cane.

## Legend and Legacy
The siblings are the namesakes of the modern-day nations of [[Kerzta\|Kerzta]] and [[Lossand\|Lossand]]. According to Kerztian tradition, Lossa's [[Sand mastery\|sand mastery]] was a curse, and Kerzt tried to righteously kill her for her offense to the Sand Lord. Conversely, Lossandins say that Lossa was blessed with her power, and Kerzt tried to kill her out of jealousy, which caused her to flee into the desert and found Lossand. Either way, the siblings disagreed on how to worship the Sand Lord, and their beliefs formed the basis of the [[Ker'reen\|Ker'reen]] religion and the  philosophy.
This schism was never resolved, and it led to wars between the two nations despite their shared heritage and similar language. Even during times of peace, members of each ethnic group that live in the other nation are stereotyped or met with scorn.
