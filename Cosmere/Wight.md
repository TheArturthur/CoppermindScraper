**Wights** (sometimes also called *landswights*) are unseen magical entities in medieval England. To most people, the wights are simply invisible, but [[Skop\|skops]] notice them from shadows in the corners of their vision. A wight will serve the people if bound to a [[Runestone\|runestone]] and given offerings, but otherwise it may become a destructive bog.
