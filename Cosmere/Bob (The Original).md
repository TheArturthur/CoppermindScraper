This page is about the government employee from [[The Original\|The Original]].Â For the [[Taynix\|taynix]] from [[Skyward\|Skyward]], see [[Bob (Skyward)\|Bob (Skyward)]].
**Bob** is a man in the government's employ. He wears a black suit, and keeps his grey hair slicked back in a bun at the base of his neck.
Bob is one of the three other people in the room when  first wakes up at the hospital, and Bob tests her newly added combat skills. At  cue, he draws a knife and rushes Holly's bed. She defeats him easily, knocking him down with her IV pole and wrapping the line around his neck to incapacitate him. Afterwards, when she releases him, Bob compliments her on her work with the pole.
