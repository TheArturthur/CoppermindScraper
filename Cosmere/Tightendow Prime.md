**Tightendow Prime** is a planet in the [[High Empire\|High Empire]].
It is an important planet, near the core of the empire, and is home to an imperial fleet. By the end of the [[Reunification War\|Reunification War]], however, the empire's forces were stretched thin, as they had been pushing outward to hold their newly re-expanded borders. As a result, Tightendow Prime was one of the ten locations [[Varion Crestmar\|Varion Crestmar]] attacked in his rebellion against the empire.
In the empire's command center, [[Dennison Crestmar\|Dennison Crestmar]] correctly realized that Varion had taken the empire's eastern fighter flank at Tightendow Prime based only on a glance at the display screen of the battle a few minutes earlier and hearing the admiral directing that battle curse. This and other demonstrations of his knowledge of Varion's tactics convinced the [[High Emperor\|High Emperor]] to allow Dennison to transmit fake reports of the battles to Varion through a bug in Varion's ** transmitter.
