## Appearance & Personality
William Ann takes after her father in appearance, and is already taller than her mother by fourteen. She often complains of awkwardness or being too tall, but Silence thinks that these attributes imply that William Ann will be beautiful.

## History
On the night [[Silence Montane\|Silence]] spotted [[Chesterton Divide\|Chesterton Divide]] in her waystop, William Ann prepared a half dose of [[Fenweed\|fenweed]] for the men, and convinced her mother to let her come along to track them down. She helped her mother to kill Chesterton and his men for their bounty, and to recover the body from [[Red Young\|Red Young]], who later cut them off at the [[Old Bridge\|Old Bridge]] and took her hostage. She was pushed through a [[Shade\|shade]] by Red after he drew her blood.
Silence rushed her to the waystop and saved William Ann's life--stopping her from being turned into a Shade--by pouring a mixture of powdered [[Silver\|silver]] and water down her throat and on her face. However, her left side was blackened in the process, leaving her hand and some of her toes in need of amputation.
