>“*We do not have [a king]; that is a thing of the Waelish, and their Black Bear. It turned out poorly for them.*”
\-Ealstan[1]


**Bretwalda** is the [[Weswaran\|Weswaran]] term for their ruler. Although the [[Waelish\|Waelish]] kingdom has a king, in Weswara's governmental hierarchy the bretwalda fills the equivalent position and rules over the earls. Weswara did not have a bretwalda at the time [[Runian\|Runian]] first arrived in the dimension, though the [[Alwin\|earl]] who resided in [[Maelport\|Maelport]] was talking of trying to become one.
