The **Radiant Depths** is a trench in the [[Sea of Souls\|Sea of Souls]], part of the [[Shadesmar\|Rosharan subastral]] of the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]]. It is likely named after the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]].

## Geography and Geology
The trench lies in the southern Sea of Souls. It runs roughly from [[Urithiru\|Nohadon's Stairways]] at its north end to [[Nameless\|Nameless]] in the south. A long peninsula runs parallel to the southern half of the trench; the lighthouse [[Abiding Light\|Abiding Light]] is located on the peninsula. The total size of the Radiant Depths is unclear due to a lack of detailed maps of Shadesmar, but the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]] locations that appear to correspond to the trench are western [[Marat\|Marat]] and the southern [[Mountains of Ur\|mountains of Ur]].
The Radiant Depths is referred to as a "great trench" by resident [[Spren\|spren]]. Local sailors are well aware of the trench, and seem to prefer navigating the shallows that lie along its western edge.

## History
During the emissary mission from [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] to [[Lasting Integrity\|Lasting Integrity]], [[Shallan\|Shallan]] and [[Adolin\|Adolin's]] team traveled from Nohadon's Stairways to Nameless by sailing the shallows adjacent to the Radiant Depths. The [[Peakspren\|peakspren]] sailors that accompanied them had special tools to measure the depth of the bead ocean.
