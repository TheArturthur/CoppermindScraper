## Attributes and Abilities

## History
Like most residents of Diggen's Point, Brick was not allowed to leave the island, and he presumably spent his whole life there. He brewed exceptionally high-quality beer, and his ale was so renowned that sailors and merchants would make specific trips or stops to get it. He brewed his ale on weekends, and his friend [[Rod\|Rod]] would usually assist him. Brick sold his beer at a tavern on the island, where many locals would come to have a drink and play darts. At the tavern, Brick sometimes enlisted his cousin to help him keep watch over the crowd on nights when things might get rough.
[[Lem\|Lem]] was a regular patron of the tavern and Brick was well acquainted with his daughter, [[Tress\|Tress]]. When Lem cashed in on multiple favors owed to him, Brick was happy to assist Tress in her attempt to escape Diggen's Point so she could search for and rescue [[Charlie\|Charlie]]. He helped Tress sneak onto the *Oot's Dream* by providing five barrels of ale plus a sixth "dummy" keg that contained [[Gret\|Gret]], [[Sor\|Sor's]] daughter. This caused a "failed inspection" that was actually a distraction, allowing Tress to board the ship.
When Tress briefly returned to Diggen's Point after her journey, she took special care to thank Brick, [[Gremmy\|Gremmy]], Gret, and Sor for their assistance in helping her initially escape the Rock.
