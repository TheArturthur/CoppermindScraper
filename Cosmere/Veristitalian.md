## Mission
Veristitalians believe that most historians do not seek truth, instead attempting to present the most adulating picture of themselves and their own motives. Conversely, Veristitalians seek to create unbiased, factual accounts of the past in order to understand the present and be prepared for the future. The members choose research projects that they feel are misrepresented or misunderstood to study, and try to "reconstruct" the historical events to find the truth. Their research methods would be considered unconventional by traditional historians, as Veristitalians believe that folk tales and superstitions can preserve bits and pieces of history.

## History
[[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]], a prominent Veristitalian, was performing research at the [[Palanaeum\|Palanaeum]] when she first met [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] in [[Kharbranth\|Kharbranth]]. The order itself was not a secret, and she talked about it freely with [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]], [[Renarin\|Renarin]], and others.
Jasnah stayed in contact with other Veristitalians via [[Spanreed\|spanreed]]. They kept each other apprised of current events around Roshar, including the fallout from the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]]. They took particular interest in tracking the activities of notable individuals such as [[Herald\|Heralds]], [[Radiant\|Radiants]], and [[Siah Aimian\|Siah Aimians]]. Sharing information helped them formulate theories about supernatural events past and present.

## Members
Jasnah, [[Ethid\|Ethid]], and [[Jochi\|Jochi]] are Veristitalians, and all three of them studied under an unnamed master. Jasnah believes that her colleagues are among the finest minds on Roshar. She refers to the members of the group as her "sisters", although at least one member (Jochi) is actually a man who uses a female pen name. The total number of members is unknown.

## Trivia
Rosharans would not use the term "Veristitalian", instead using a term that comes from an ancient in-world language. It is translated into an invented English word to maintain the right feel for the reader, in this case drawing on the Latin root meaning "truth".
The notion of using history to affect present and future events comes from [[Brandon\|Brandon's]] own personality.
