## Relationships
### Jax
Dan and Jax are very close, and still makes time to play with Jax despite being in college. Dan and Jax play fight over bacon. Dan knows that Jax likes the crispy slices, so he pretends to steal the soggy slices from Jax's plate and replaces them with crispy slices from his own. They also enjoy reenacting Civil War scenes together and tinkering with Civil War muskets. Dan is never afraid to be silly, and makes funny faces at Jax to make him laugh.
