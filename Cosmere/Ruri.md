>“*The two of them painted with toothpaste on the wall until the girl was laughing again. Until Ruri understood that mistakes could sometimes turn into amazing, wonderful, cherished things. With the right perspective.*”
\-Allriandre[1]


**Ruri** is the daughter of [[Allriandre\|Allriandre]] in [[Elendel\|Elendel]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. She is small for her age. She gets nervous around strangers but feels comfortable with her mother.
Ruri lived alone with her mother, who rented from Miss [[Coussaint\|Coussaint]] and had their landlady watch Ruri while she worked at the forges. The woman often caused Ruri to feel terrified. One day when Miss Coussaint caught Ruri painting with toothpaste on the wall, she was shouting at the girl when Allriandre came home; after the landlady left, Ruri and her mother continued painting on the wall until she was happy. [[Call\|Call]] and [[Garisel Daring\|Garisel Daring]] then came to speak with Allriandre about [[Wayne\|Wayne's]] estate, and Ruri climbed into her mother's lap and wiped her nose on Allriandre's jumpsuit. She got toothpaste on the note Wayne left for her mother.
