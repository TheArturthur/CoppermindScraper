## Description
The shape is similar to a Chinese scepter known as a  and it is pale blue in color, echoing the color of Sel's moon [[Oem\|Oem]]. It has [[Aon\|Aons]] written or inscribed on one side of it.

## History
The origin of the Moon Scepter is unknown.
[[Shai\|Shai]] wanted to swap the real scepter with her own forged copy as a test of her skill, because it was the most famous piece of art in the whole empire. After an elaborate plan that also included the theft and forgery of a painting by [[Han ShuXen\|Han ShuXen]], she was betrayed at the last moment by [[Hoid\|Hoid]] (whom she knew as the Imperial Fool) and imprisoned. Shai assumed that the Fool escaped with the original scepter and that her forged version now sat in the gallery. Hoid did take the original scepter but its fate after that point is unknown.

## Use
### Translation Device
The Moon Scepter is not simply ornamental; it is a translation device between sets of symbols that are used to access [[Investiture\|Investiture]] in the various Selish magic systems. This is significant because Sel's numerous manifestations of Investiture are similar to computer programming languages. The scepter presumably has other symbols written or inscribed on it that correspond to the Aons known to be on one side. A knowledgeable individual would therefore be able to use the translations to gain an understanding of the symbols that are integral to various types of Selish magic.

### Access to Investiture
This page or section deals with theories or speculation.Please read carefully and note that this is not necessarily canonical.

Selish magic is particularly powerful, but despite a common power source (the [[Dor\|Dor]]), each type of magic is usually only usable by people native to specific areas of Sel. Additionally, Selish magic typically gets weaker as the distance from its homeland increases. These properties vary for each specific magic system, but Selish magic generally does not work on other planets. This is a problem that some characters are actively trying to solve.
Although the Moon Scepter does not remove these geographic restrictions, thus far it is the only known object that could make this task "less daunting". Someone that is able to use at least one type of Selish magic might be able to use the information on the scepter to gain access to one or more additional types of magic (including [[AonDor\|AonDor]], [[Forgery\|Forgery]], [[ChayShan\|ChayShan]], [[Dakhor\|Dakhor]], Invested potions, [[Bloodsealing\|Bloodsealing]], and more). Alternatively, the translation could allow the powers of a magic system to be accessed using different symbols in non-native locations (for example, an [[Elantrian\|Elantrian]] traveling to [[Fjorden\|Fjorden]] might be able to use AonDor with Dakhor glyphs rather than Aons). Notably, the scepter provides information about Selish magics, but it does not inherently grant the holder access to any of its manifestations.
The scepter is a piece of a much larger puzzle that could theoretically allow conversion between different types of [[Investiture\|Investiture]], even beyond those found on Sel. The translation information on the scepter was the reason for Hoid's interest, and he has already gotten what he needs from it.

## Trivia
Brandon has not confirmed whether or not the scepter itself is Invested, but it is unlikely since it does not seem to have particular value to Hoid.
The Moon Scepter is likely to reappear in a future book, at least as a cameo.
[[Shallan\|Shallan]] sees a stick with unreadable writing on it in [[Mraize\|Mraize's]] "trophy room", but it is not the Moon Scepter.
