The **Song of Wars** is one of the songs detailing the oral history of the [[Listener\|listeners]]. It was likely one of the songs written by the [[Last Legion\|Last Legion]] in order to keep their memories alive.
It has at least fifty-five stanzas, and it presumably details the history of various listener wars. Notably, the song states that the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] were not created by the listener gods, the [[Fused\|Fused]]. It also indicates that written records with more information about the Shattering once existed, but they have since been lost.
