The **Frostlands** are the lawless, sparsely populated southeastern lands of [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. They are located outside the boundaries of [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]]. They receive the strongest highstorms out of all of Roshar, due to the Frostlands being closest to the Origin out of all of the Stormlands, i.e. Eastern Roshar.
Prominent locations in the Frostlands include [[Kharbranth\|Kharbranth]], the [[Unclaimed Hills\|Unclaimed Hills]], the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]], [[Dawn's Shadow\|Dawn's Shadow]], [[New Natanan\|New Natanan]], and the [[Shallow Crypts\|Shallow Crypts]]. It approximately coincides with the ancient [[Silver Kingdom\|Silver Kingdom]] of [[Natanatan\|Natanatan]].

  Map of the Frostlands
## Flora
[[Rockbud\|Rockbuds]] in the Frostlands grow smaller than those in warmer areas; they never get bigger than a fist and do not open all the way. Grass grows in patchy portions on the leeward side of rocks, with spiky short blades rather than long wavy blades.

## Weather
The Frostlands seem to be unusually cold, and offer little protection against [[Highstorm\|Highstorms]].
