***Eternathis*** is a written history of eastern [[Roshar\|Roshar]] during the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]]. The author is unknown.
*Eternathis* is a philosophical book that discusses the history of Roshar since the fall of the [[Hierocracy\|Hierocracy]]. It focuses solely on the interactions between the five [[Vorin\|Vorin]] kingdoms ([[Kharbranth\|Kharbranth]], [[Natanatan\|Natanatan]], [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]], [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]], and [[Thaylenah\|Thaylenah]]), and is therefore an exhaustive treatment of its subject.
In 1173, Brightness [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] bought a copy of *Eternathis* in four blue-gray volumes from the merchant [[Artmyrn\|Artmyrn]] in [[Kharbranth\|Kharbranth]] so that she could study history. Princess [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]] was pleased by her choice.
