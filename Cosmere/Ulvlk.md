## Appearance and Personality
Ulvlk is a young [[Thaylen\|Thaylen]] woman. She is loyal to her guild, but she is also concerned about the greater good.

## Attributes and Abilities
As a member of the [[Vriztl Guild\|Vriztl Guild]], Ulvlk is knowledgeable regarding the known properties of [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]] and [[Fabrial\|fabrials]], including certain "trade secrets" that are shared only among guild members. She serves in Queen [[Fen Rnamdi\|Fen Rnamdi's]] court in [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]].

## History
In 1175, Ulvlk and her colleague [[Vrandl\|Vrandl]] visited [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] to listen to [[Navani\|Navani's]] lectures on [[Fabrial\|fabrials]]. During their visit, [[Raboniel\|Raboniel]] invaded the tower and fighting between the [[Singer\|singers]] and humans commenced. Navani made contact with the [[Sibling\|Sibling]] and began receiving information about Raboniel's likely plans. As an expert on fabrials, Navani was aware that the two Thaylen scholars might have confidential information that would be crucial to defending the tower, and she kept them close by.
Acting on the Sibling's instructions, Navani sought a method to quickly transfer Stormlight between [[Polestone\|gemstones]]. Vrandl became suspicious since Navani needed very specific information that only she and Ulvlk could provide, and believed that Navani was trying to trick them into revealing their "trade secrets". Navani rebuked the Thaylens for withholding information that could potentially save humanity. Although she initially resisted, Ulvlk decided to reveal the Vriztl secret of using a [[/wiki/Lights#The Tones]] created by tuning forks to transfer Light between gems. Ulvlk was nervous about giving Navani this information; Vrandl maintained her position that Navani's motivation was a ruse, and told Ulvlk that she would be expelled by the guild for revealing their secret, although Navani reassured Ulvlk that she only wanted to stop the invaders. Navani presumably soon convinced Vrandl that she was genuine, as the [[Coalition of monarchs\|coalition]] scholars were provided with two tuning forks by the Thaylens.
Ulvlk's decision to reveal the Thaylen method of Stormlight transfer allowed the Sibling to temporarily protect their [[/wiki/Sibling#Crystal Pillar]] from [[Raboniel\|Raboniel]]. It was also a turning point in Navani's scholarly knowledge of Lights and [[Rhythm\|Rhythms]]. Navani and [[Rushu\|Rushu]] had been unable to deduce the relatively simple tuning fork method that had been passed down in the [[Vriztl Guild\|Vriztl Guild]] for centuries. Learning of the [[Thaylen\|Thaylen]] method (which actually used the pure tone of [[Honor\|Honor]]) was foundational to Navani's later breakthroughs while she was held captive by Raboniel, including [[Warlight\|Warlight]] and [[Anti-Voidlight\|Anti-Voidlight]].
