## Ship Models Used
For more information, see [[Starfighter\|starfighter]].
For a list of ship models, see DDF Ships.
The DDF uses a variety of starfighters, each built for a specific purpose. While some ships, such as the [[Poco\|Poco]] are traditionally used in dogfights against Krell, other ships like the [[Val\|Val]] are used for reconnaissance. The most common destructor type used in DDF ships is the 138 Stewart destructor and generally cap out at speeds of Mag-10.

## Flights
A Flight at the Defiant Defense Force usually consists of 8-10 pilots who have graduated from the flight school. At any given time, 1/3 of all starfighters and pilots are down in the deeper caverns in case Alta Base is bombed, so the DDF can rebuild. Each flight has a flightleader, who is responsible for coordinating the flight and relaying messages from Flight Command. Each flight ideally has an even number of pilots, so that each pilot can have a wingmate.
