## Appearance and Personality
Adin is a thirteen-year-old darkeyed boy. He is very brave, risking his life in the fight to escape [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]]. He hopes that his bravery will attract an [[Honorspren\|honorspren]] and allow him to join the [[Windrunners\|Windrunners]]. This belief caused him to glare at passing [[Regals\|Regals]] during the occupation of Urithiru, though not when they were watching. He is relieved when he can walk without a limp after hurting his ankle, as he believes that a sign of weakness might scare off a potential [[Radiant\|Radiant]] bond.

## History
Adin was a resident of [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] during the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]]. He worked for his father, a potter named [[Alalan\|Alalan]], though the bowls he made were often lopsided. Sometime before [[Raboniel\|Raboniel's]] invasion of the tower, he fell down the stairs while pretending to be a [[Windrunner\|Windrunner]], after which [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] bandaged his ankle and told him to walk with a crutch. His ankle got better later on, so when his father wanted to watch a battle in Urithitu, Adin followed to help and earn his own [[Spren\|spren]]. When the humans protected the fallen [[Radiant\|Radiants]], Adin first tried to hide and only joined the fight later on when his father was already wounded. During the battle, Adin feared for his life, but both he and his father survived as they were saved by [[Dabbid\|Dabbid]] and Kaladin, who had just earned his [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]].

## Relationships
### Alalan
Adin's father. When [[Alalan\|Alalan]] catches Adin glaring at the [[Regals\|Regals]], he warns him to keep his eyes down, lest he is caught and killed. Adin views his father as extremely brave for tending the fallen radiants directly beneath the gaze of the [[Fused\|Fused]].

### Kaladin
Adin respects and reveres [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]], viewing him with a sense of awe. He is embarrassed that he missed seeing Kaladin fight for the well node, an event that he napped through.

### Shar
[[Shar\|Shar]] is the daughter of a seamstress in [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] which Adin doesn't particularly like. According to him, she is bossy enough that one would think she is [[Lighteyed\|lighteyed]]. Her uncle is a [[Windrunner\|Windrunner]]. When Adin catches her glaring at [[Warform\|warform]] [[Singer\|singers]] he thinks that she is trying to attract her own [[Honorspren\|honorspren]].

### Master Liganor
Master [[Liganor\|Liganor]] is the lighteyed owner of the pottery Adin's father is working at. Adin thinks he is nice and appreciates the bravery of keeping the shop open during the occupation, though he did close the shop when a fight broke out.
