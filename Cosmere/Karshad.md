\-'May the Sand Lord bless us!' in Karshad[1]


**Karshad** is a holy language spoken by members of the Priest [[DaiKeen\|DaiKeen]], the clergy of the [[Ker'reen\|Ker'reen]] religion in [[Kerzta\|Kerzta]] on [[Taldain\|Taldain]].
When [[Khriss\|Khriss]] and her team first arrived on [[Dayside\|Dayside]], she and [[Cynder\|Cynder]] had learned some Karshad by studying Daysider books. When Cynder spoke the language to the locals, they seemed to understand but quickly fled in fear. The Darksider team then overheard a priest (possibly the [[A'kar\|A'kar]]) speaking Karshad, and realized that they had inadvertently learned a holy language. Cynder was considered to be [[Elis\|Elis's]] foremost authority on Daysider linguistics, and his ignorance of the common language was symptomatic of the schism between the two regions.
