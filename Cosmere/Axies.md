## Attributes and Abilities
>“*They can take off their limbs. Take off their skin too. No real body to them. Just something evil, taking human form.*”
\-Nlent to Rsyn[5]


Axies can manipulate his body, which can change his abilities (for instance, he can sculpt his nose so that he can no longer smell). Like all Aimians, he can change the color and markings of his skin at will. His shadow casts toward light. 
Axies speaks Thaylen with a unique accent.

## History
For more images, see [[Axies/Gallery\|/Gallery]].
Given the hostility his race and appearance attracts and the likelihood of losing his possessions, he took to making his research notes by using his Aimian talent for altering his body to create tattoo-like markings on his skin for later reference.
Throughout his life, Axies has visited the [[Valley\|Valley]] to try and see the [[Nightwatcher\|Nightwatcher]] several dozen times, but has yet to be successful.

 
He was searching for evidence of the existence of [[Alespren\|alespren]] by getting drunk somewhere in [[Kasitor\|Kasitor]] when he was beaten by unknown persons, robbed of his possessions, and left for dead in an alley. Axies awakened the next day naked, lying on a pile of foul-smelling rotted vegetables, and suffering only from a headache. He used his ability to suppress his sense of smell and to banish the headache. He then met a crazy [[Beggar (Kasitor)\|beggar]] who was furious that his city of rotted vegetables had been trampled. The beggar asked Axies if he was a [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringer]] or a [[Herald\|Herald]] because of the destruction he caused to the beggar's city. After stating that he was a Voidbringer, Axies cleverly convinced the beggar to give him his blanket, so he wouldn’t be arrested for public nudity. Soon after, while observing [[Cusicesh\|Cusicesh]] in the city, the blanket was stolen from him by a street urchin and Axies was seized by the guards and arrested for public indecency.
Later on, [[Rysn\|Rysn]] found Axies hanging upside down from his feet as punishment for offending the religion of the people on one of the [[Reshi Isles\|Reshi Isles]]. He had travelled to the Reshi Isles in order to find the Tai-Na's spren, which he speculated would be "spectacular" in comparison to the spren of normal greatshells. She refers to him as a voidbringer, which seems to be how Thaylens following the Passions view Aimians.
Shortly after the rediscovery of [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], [[Jochi\|Jochi]] mentions a sighting of Axies in a [[Spanreed\|spanreed]] communication with [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]].
