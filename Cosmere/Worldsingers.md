>“*I am not a foolish jester or storyteller. I do not 'give tales.' I spread knowledge of cultures, peoples, thoughts, and dreams. I bring peace through understanding. It is the holy charge my order received from the Heralds themselves.*”
\-Sigzil on the Worldsingers[1]


The **Worldsingers** are an organization of storytellers and knowledge-givers on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. They were founded by [[Hoid\|Hoid]], and were active during the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]] and the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]].

## Mission
Worldsingers travel the world learning of other places and cultures and sharing information about the places they have already been. When they visit a new place, they tend to ask many questions and seek precise answers. Their knowledge of kingdoms and cultures is extensive, and can include various topics such as history, religion, geography, architecture, trade, local traditions, and demographics. They see themselves as superior to traditional storytellers, charged by the [[Herald\|Heralds]] to spread knowledge. Some Worldsingers do use stories to put people at ease; they may use allegories to help pass on information. Hoid, who is the creator and a member of the Worldsingers, used a [[Trailman's flute\|Trailman's flute]] when he told stories but it is unclear if the flute is related to his Worldsinger status or one of his many other abilities.

## History
During the thirty-first year of the [[Heraldic Epochs\|Sixth Epoch]], [[Hoid\|Hoid]], who was already a Master Worldsinger, tasked an apprentice Worldsinger, [[Senne Khald\|Senne Khald]], with writing a treatise on the [[Knights Radiant\|Radiant Orders]] as part of her apprenticeship. She performed her research and recorded many of her notes in a journal.
In 1170, [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] thought that there might be a Worldsinger at the [[Middlefest Fair\|Middlefest Fair]] sponsored by her family. She knew what Worldsingers were like and seemed to find their presence relatively commonplace, implying that the group had been active in [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]] for some time.
At some point prior to 1173, [[Sigzil\|Sigzil]] failed to pass the [[Azir\|Azish]] exams to become a public servant; he subsequently started getting into trouble and was rescued by Hoid, who took him on as an apprentice. Sigzil traveled with Hoid, including a trip to [[Babatharnam\|Babatharnam]]. Hoid expressed some frustration with Sigzil as an apprentice, noting that he was sometimes judgmental or foolish, and he had to rescue him on multiple occasions. At some point, the pair became separated. Sigzil attempted to kill someone for unknown reasons and became a member of a [[Bridge crew\|bridge crew]].
Sigzil did not tell anyone on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] that he was a Worldsinger. However, [[Lunamor\|Lunamor]] was able to identify Sigzil as a member of the order without any apparent prior knowledge of his history. It is unclear if this is related to Lunamor's rare ability as a [[Sighted\|Sighted]]. Once the secret was out, Sigzil began telling the other bridgemen about distant places such as [[Sesemalex Dar\|Sesemalex Dar]].
During Sigzil's stint in the bridge crews, Hoid had some reason to believe that he was dead. Sigzil did not contact Hoid to let him know that he was still alive, possibly because he did not want to be rescued again. Once Hoid learned that Sigzil was alive, he promoted him from an apprentice to a full Worldsinger. After Sigzil was freed and became a Knight Radiant, he continued to serve as a Worldsinger and hoped to improve his storytelling skills.

## Notable Worldsingers
[[Hoid\|Hoid]]: Master Worldsinger
[[Sigzil\|Sigzil]]: A full Worldsinger, former apprentice to Hoid
[[Senne Khald\|Senne Khald]]: An apprentice Worldsinger.
## Trivia
There is a connection between Worldsingers, the [[Terris\|Terris]] [[Worldbringers\|Worldbringers]], and possibly other groups in the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]]. The similarity in their names is not a coincidence. Given Hoid's [[Worldhopping\|worldhopping]] abilities, fans have speculated that he is the connection, but [[Brandon\|Brandon]] has not confirmed this.
Brandon would consider himself akin to a Worldsinger.
