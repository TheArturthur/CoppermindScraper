## Attributes and Abilities
As a member of the Vriztl Guild, Vrandl is knowledgeable regarding the known properties of [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]] and [[Fabrial\|fabrials]], including certain "trade secrets" that are shared only among guild members. She serves in Queen [[Fen Rnamdi\|Fen Rnamdi's]] court in [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]].

## History
In 1175, Vrandl and Ulvlk visited [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] to listen to Navani's lectures on fabrials. During their visit, [[Raboniel\|Raboniel]] invaded the tower and fighting between the [[Singer\|singers]] and humans commenced. Navani made contact with the [[Sibling\|Sibling]] and began receiving information about Raboniel's likely plans. As an expert on fabrials, Navani was aware that the two Thaylen scholars might have confidential information that would be crucial to defending the tower, and she kept them close by.
Acting on the Sibling's instructions, Navani sought a method to quickly transfer Stormlight between gemstones. Vrandl became suspicious since Navani needed very specific information that only she and Ulvlk could provide, and believed that Navani was trying to trick them into revealing their "trade secrets". Navani rebuked the Thaylens for withholding information that could potentially save humanity, but Vrandl remained silent. Ulvlk, however, decided to reveal the Vriztl secret of using a specific sound frequency created by tuning forks to transfer Light between gems. Vrandl was incensed; she maintained her position that Navani's motivation was a ruse. She told Ulvlk that she would be expelled by the guild for revealing their secret, although Navani reassured a nervous Ulvlk that she only wanted to stop the invaders. Vrandl was presumably persuaded by Navani, as the [[Coalition of monarchs\|coalition]] scholars were soon provided with two tuning forks by the Thaylens.
