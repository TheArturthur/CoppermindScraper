**Tremredare** is a large city in the [[Western Dominance\|Western Dominance]] of the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]]. It is one of [[Scadrial\|Scadrial's]] major cultural centers before the [[Collapse\|Collapse]].
It is located in the southwest portion of the Dominance, west of [[Morag\|Morag]] and near the base of a mountain range. A river or canal connects Tremredare to [[Lake Tyrian\|Lake Tyrian]] via [[Chardees\|Chardees]] and [[Fadrex City\|Fadrex City]]. Another arm of the same waterway connects to the [[River Channerel\|River Channerel]].
Tremredare served as the capital of the Western Dominance until [[Ashweather Cett\|Ashweather Cett]] seized power in the area and moved the capital to Fadrex City since it was smaller and more defensible.
It is unclear if anything remains in Tremredare's former location after the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]].
