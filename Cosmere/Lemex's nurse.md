This article's title is uncanonical and a fan created one, because an official term or name has not been made yet.
**Lemex's nurse** is a [[Terris\|Terriswoman]] [[Worldhopper\|worldhopper]] who acts as a nurse to [[Lemex\|Lemex]] when he is poisoned during the [[Pahn Kahl rebellion\|Pahn Kahl rebellion]] on [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]].
When [[Vivenna\|Vivenna]] came to visit Lemex on his deathbed, his solemn nurse told her that nothing more could be done to help him. Vivenna dismissed the nurse before Lemex gave her all of his [[Breath\|Breaths]]. With the aid of [[Denth\|Denth's]] crew, the nurse disposed of Lemex's body later that night. Denth later mentioned that he paid off the nurse while dealing with Lemex's property, claiming that she had not really known who Lemex was anyway.

## Trivia
When asked about background worldhoppers, Brandon frequently referred to a Terriswoman without revealing any other details about her. After some time, fans narrowed down the possibilities and directly asked if Lemex's nurse was this Terriswoman worldhopper. Brandon has confirmed that she is, although there is nothing in the text of *Warbreaker* to clue readers into her mysterious identity.
Brandon has implied that she has access to some form of [[Investiture\|Investiture]].
Fans continue to speculate about the nurse's identity, often mentioning [[Aslydin\|Aslydin]] or [[Axindweth\|Axindweth]], but Brandon has not confirmed anything and may still be waiting to reveal more details in a future book.
