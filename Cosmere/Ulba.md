>“*Everything is extraordinary about you, Tress. That's why nothing in particular stands out.*”
\-Ulba[2]


**Ulba** is a citizen of [[Diggen's Point\|Diggen's Point]] on [[Lumar\|Lumar]]. She is [[Tress\|Tress']] mother. Ulba is kind, practical and supportive.
To make money, Ulba spends her days knitting socks and selling them to sailors. Her husband [[Lem\|Lem]] helps her with this task. However, the cost of the yarn means this is not a very profitable job. Ulba is a capable seamstress and alters a spare inspector's uniform to fit Tress.
Ulba cares deeply about her family and wants to keep them safe--she used to give up part of her meals to her children, and as a result was very thin until Tress took over buying and preparing food for the family. She is physically affectionate with Tress. She initially thinks Tress's plan to save [[Charlie\|Charlie]] is "lunacy," but once she is convinced by Tress and Lem, she is supportive and helpful. She takes notes on the ships that enter and leave, and studies how outgoing shipments are searched to find a way for Tress to escape.
Ulba joined Tress on the *[[Two Cups\|Two Cups]]* following the king's declaration that the citizens of Diggen's Point are permitted to leave.
