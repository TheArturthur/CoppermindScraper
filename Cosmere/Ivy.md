**Ivy** is one of [[Stephen Leeds\|Stephen Leeds]]' earliest .
She is in her early forties and has blonde hair. She is a psychiatrist, and appeared to generally do Stephen's thinking. She often makes connections and assumptions about people's characters and motives, and will feed Stephen lines during interrogations. Stephen often relies heavily on her advise and help, and when in Legion: Skin Deep she is not present to help him, he finds himself expecting her input. She is trypophobic, although she "mostly has it under control," and dislikes any swearing, even words such as 'damn' or 'hell.'
Ivy also has a strong love/hate relationship with [[J.C.\|J.C.]]. Apparently, this is the first time that two of Stephen's aspects have ever been in such a relationship.

## Trivia
All of the aspects, except Kalyani, were loosely based on famous actors. Ivy was based on .
