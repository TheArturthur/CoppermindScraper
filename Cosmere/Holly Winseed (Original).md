Holly first met Jonathan at the [[Riverside Marketplace\|Riverside Marketplace]], at [[Stilla\|Stilla]]’s citrus stand. Once they were married, they lived in their apartment together, with Jonathan often going to scientific conferences and giving talks. Jonathan went on a two week trip, and he came back slightly different. Holly began to grow suspeicious, and she confronted him at a party.
