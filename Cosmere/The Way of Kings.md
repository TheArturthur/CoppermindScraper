## Synopsis
*I long for the days before the [[Last Desolation\|Last Desolation]].*
*The age before the [[Herald\|Heralds]] abandoned us and the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] turned against us. A time when there was still magic in the world and honor in the hearts of men.*
*The world became ours, and we lost it. Nothing, it appears, is more challenging to the souls of men than victory itself.*
*Or was that victory an illusion all along? Did our enemies realize that the harder they fought, the stronger we resisted? Perhaps they saw that the heat and the hammer only make for a better grade of sword. But ignore the steel long enough, and it will eventually rust away.*
*There are four whom we watch. The first is [[Kaladin\|the surgeon]], forced to put aside healing to become a soldier in the most brutal war of our time. The second is [[Szeth\|the assassin]], a murderer who weeps as he kills. The third is [[Shallan\|the liar]], a young woman who wears a scholar’s mantle over the heart of a thief. The last is [[Dalinar\|the highprince]], a warlord whose eyes have opened to the past as his thirst for battle wanes.*
*The world can change. [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]] and [[Shardwielding\|Shardwielding]] can return; the magics of ancient days can become ours again. These four people are key.*
*One of them may redeem us.*
*And one of them will destroy us.*

## Cover Flap
Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.
It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars are fought for them, and won by them.
One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.
Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called *The Way of Kings*. Troubled by overpowering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.
Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under the eminent scholar and notorious heretic Jasnah Kholin, Dalinar's niece. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.

## Summary
For a chapter by chapter summary, see [[The Way of Kings/Summary\|/Summary]].
The book is set on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] and follows the stories of [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]], [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]], and [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]]. There are also several minor characters who receive viewpoints; [[Szeth\|Szeth]], [[Adolin Kholin\|Adolin Kholin]], [[Wit\|Wit]], and [[Navani Kholin\|Navani Kholin]] in the main text, and several others in the Interludes.

### Kaladin
**[[Kaladin\|Kaladin]]** is the focus character of the novel. At the beginning of his story, he is a squadleader in [[Amaram\|Amaram's]] army. His storyline then cuts to his time as a slave. He is sold to [[Shattered Plains\| Sadeas's warcamp]], where he is placed in [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]], and made to run headlong into enemy fire with the rest of his bridgecrew to give the army a way to cross the chasms as well as drawing enemy arrows away from troops. After a period of despair, Kaladin works to improve the life of his bridgecrew. He trains them so that the bridge runs won't tire them out so much, saves the lives of injured bridgemen, and slowly gets them to start caring again, and to see themselves as soldiers. Kaladin also plans to find a way to escape from Sadeas's army.
Kaladin faces the internal struggles of his inability to save those around him and his distrust of any lighteyes.
As the focus character of *The Way of Kings*, Kaladin's past is viewed through the use of flashbacks. The flashbacks show his childhood and his surgeon apprenticeship under his father, as well as how he joins the army and why he became a slave.

### Dalinar
**[[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]]'**s story centers around the politics of the Alethi nobility.
Following his brother [[Gavilar\|Gavilar's]] assassination, Dalinar took his last words to heart, and began following the [[Alethi Codes of War\|Alethi Codes of War]] and the teachings of [[The Way of Kings (in-world)\|The Way of Kings]], a book written by [[Nohadon\|Nohadon]]. He is plagued by visions of the past during every [[Highstorm\|highstorm]], and has a strong sense that the war on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] is not what the king needs to be focused on, but rather uniting the Alethi highprinces completely. Following the betrayal by [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas]], he finally drops politics and embraces the Blackthorn, realizing that he must force the highprinces to unite and finish the war quickly, so they may focus on the [[Desolation\|Desolation]] to come.

### Shallan
**[[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]]** becomes the ward of the rather infamous scholar [[Jasnah\|Jasnah]], in the hopes of stealing her [[Soulcaster\|Soulcaster]]. Her story is a mostly internal conflict between continuing her wardship, which she loves, and stealing the [[Fabrial\|fabrial]] to help her family. As her conflict progresses, Shallan begins to draw mysterious spren when she's not paying attention, and she believes she is going mad. Things come to a head when her love interest [[Kabsal\|Kabsal]] is caught trying to poison Jasnah, and Shallan's theft is revealed. She confronts Jasnah, who can also see the spren and can [[Soulcast\|Soulcast]] without the use of a fabrial, and she reveals that she is researching the [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]].

### Szeth
**[[Szeth\|Szeth]]'**s story is told through the Interludes. A [[Truthless\|Truthless]] of [[Shinovar\|Shinovar]], he is first introduced when he famously assassinates King Gavilar of [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]]. Known as the Assassin in White, he goes through several masters before getting orders to assassinate several high-ranking people by a mysterious master. Hating himself, he murders the people on his list until he gets to King [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]], who turns out to be the man holding his [[Oathstone\|oathstone]].

## Setting
### Magic System
Roshar has several magic systems. Most of these are used by the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] orders, with some of these powers including [[Soulcast\|Soulcasting]] and [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]]. Independent of the Radiant orders is the [[Old Magic\|Old Magic]].
The [[Ten Essences\|Ten Essences]] have not been elaborated on much in the book, though they have something to do with Soulcasting.
