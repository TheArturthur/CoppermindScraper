**Tigzikk** is a thief on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] who attempted to rob the [[Bronze Palace\|Bronze Palace]]. He is also known as "Tig" to [[Lift\|Lift]], who is unable to properly pronounce his name.

## Appearance and Personality
Tigzikk is an aging [[Makabaki\|Makabaki]] man with dark hair and skin. During the Bronze Palace heist, he wears fancy clothing made to imitate that of [[Azir\|Azish]] civil servants.
He's considered scholarly within [[Huqin\|Huqin's]] crew for being able to curse in three languages. He's also cautious, and serves as a voice of reason for the group, discussing whether or not they should rob the Palace.

## History
Tigzikk was the only one in Huqin's crew who knew [[Lift\|Lift]] well, and he vouched for her capabilities. Lift mentioned helping the crew because she "owed" Tigzikk, although she did not say why. Tigzikk found out about the ongoing [[Prime Aqasix\|Prime Aqasix]] election in 1173, which allowed easier access into the Bronze Palace, and proposed the plan to rob it. During the theft, he and fellow crew member [[Maxin\|Maxin]] infiltrated the Palace garden to mingle with the bureaucrats there, the plan being that they would alert the rest if an alarm was raised.
