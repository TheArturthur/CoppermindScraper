The **Border Ocean** is a massive ocean which covers most of [[Taldain\|Taldain]] and separates [[Dayside\|Dayside]] from [[Darkside\|Darkside]]. It is sorted into the Northern Border Ocean and Southern Border Ocean.
Directly between Dayside and Darkside, along the center of the Border Ocean, is a powerful storm known as the **Terminal Storm**. Supposedly formed by the temperature differential between Dayside and Darkside, the terminal storm can take more than two days to sail across.
The sea is full of oxygen-producing algae, which provide much of the oxygen in Taldain's atmosphere.
