## Setting
Alornia is a High Fantasy State. As such the technology level is around medieval times, but magic allows fantastical things to occur. Fantastical creatures, such as dragons, and magical items and artifacts exist within Alornia as well.
Alornia's sky contains the [[Grand Aurora\|Grand Aurora]], a blue-violet light that pierces storms and gives Alornia's ground a faint blue hue.

## History
Before Kai unified the State, Alornia featured forty different kingdoms all crammed into a single continent. As a result war was a constant, and the bloodshed only stopped when Kai united the kingdoms 50 years ago. It is possible there was more than one continent involved, too.

## Magic
The main magic system within Alornia is called [[Lancing\|Lancing]], and is only usable by Kai. It allows him to manipulate energy and create force fields, among other things. Other magic also exists in Alornia, however, as Kai has found magical treasure in his adventuring days, including his enchanted sword [[Indelebrean\|Indelebrean]]. There is also a set of items known as [[Aurorastone\|Aurorastones]], which allow various effects and can power foreign technology, and [[Boosts\|Boosts]], which grant the individual enhanced abilities.

## Capital
Alornia is also the name of the capital city of the State. It is a bustling city located at the center of Kai's power, whose architecture involves golden domes on top of towers. The city's weather is always sunny and nice, controlled to be so by an Aurorastone. The center of the city has a hill, atop which sits Kai's palace.

## Border States
Alornia has several [[/wiki/State#Border States]], where [[Liveborn\|Liveborns]] compete for the special resources in the area.
