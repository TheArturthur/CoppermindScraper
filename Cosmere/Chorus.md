>“*We were the first who died on Canticle. The first to live in this land and devise the designs of flight—based on the ships that brought us here. But then we died and rose as shades. Remembering.*”
\-A shade in the Chorus on Beacon[1]


The **Chorus** is a term for groups of contained [[Shade\|shades]] on [[Canticle\|Canticle]]. The shades in the Chorus display significant differences from normal [[Threnody\|Threnodite]] shades.

## History
Following the original immigration to Canticle, the first Threnodites to die became shades, these shades would later become known as the Chorus. From there, portions of the Chorus were taken to new settlements in specialized jars, these shades would enable cities like [[Union\|Union]] and [[Beacon\|Beacon]] to thrive.

## Culture
Each settlement on Canticle has a Chorus of their own, kept in a specialized containment chamber called a Reliquary--a glass drum with an open top. The Reliquary is often located in the middle of a settlement. Those in the Chorus are able to be divided amongst settlements by transferring some of the [[Investiture\|smoke]] from their Reliquary, this is done with the founding of any new settlement.
Canticlites believe that the people who die without being given to the sun join the Chorus. They sometimes see mist gather after a death, which then moves to the Reliquary. This belief likely originates with the Chorus itself as it tells how it is made of those who first died on Canticle and that others must be given to the sun to prevent the small planet from becoming overrun with shades. However, this belief is erroneous as it is confirmed that those who die on Canticle, from the sun or otherwise, are converted into [[Sunheart\|sunhearts]] and do not become part of the Chorus. It is unclear if the Chorus is intentionally lying, if it is ignorant of the system's mechanics, or if something has changed since it was created it is not aware of.
Each Chorus holds the history of those who fled to the planet, they are also instrumental in keeping the Canticlites alive.

## Abilities
>“*Shades do not remember. We are not shades. We are the Chorus of the people.*”
\-A shade in the Beaconite Chorus[1]

The Chorus is quite different from regular Shades. While they do express a desire to kill and absorb the Investiture of the living beings around them, the Chorus are remarkably docile compared to their Threnodite equivalents.

### Remembering
Despite being Threnodite [[Cognitive Shadow\|Cognitive Shadows]] in origin, The Chorus claim that they are not shades, citing their ability to remember as a significant difference. This may be a result of the unique Connection properties between groups of Canticlites. It's unclear if individual shades contribute any knowledge to the Chorus, as the shades functionally act as a single entity once they have been assimilated, generally only speaking as the original immigrants from [[Threnody\|Threnody]].

### Fabrication
Arguably the most notable function of the Chorus is the ability to fabricate nearly anything from raw materials after observing relevant blueprints or schematics--the process bearing resemblance to the methods living [[Shardblade\|Shardblades]] use to change shape. Similarly, the length of time it takes for the Chorus to fabricate any given object is influenced by how familiar the shades are with the process.
