**Skylights** are massive lights that provide illumination and warmth to [[Detritus\|Detritus]].
The skylights were presumably placed in low orbit around [[Detritus\|Detritus]] when the humans living there decided to build thousands of semiautonomous defensive [[Platform\|platforms]] to create a "shell" around the planet, which had the side effect of blocking out the light from its sun.
They are incredibly large and very bright, even when viewed from the planet's surface.  The light is relatively focused, like a giant spotlight, and anything outside of the beams remains relatively dark. Their orbit is low and fast enough that their movement is visible to people on the surface.
The skylights are programmed to provide an artificial day/night cycle. The lights in a given area will dim and then eventually turn off to simulate night.

## Trivia
The term "skylight" is also used for the real-life architectural feature of the same name.
