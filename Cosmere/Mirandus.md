## Culture and Society
### Nations
For a list of locations on Mirandus, see :Category:Mirandus.
Mirandus is primarily split into two nations, the Kingdoms of Light, and the Blackened Lands, each the primary home of different beings. The Kingdoms of Light is home to a race of pre-industrial humans, whilst the Blackened Lands are the lands of the [[Drull\|drull]], human-like beings born grown from the soils of Mirandus.

### Time
Time works differently on Mirandus to Earth, with the people of Mirandus not understanding the concept of an hour. A day and night cycle is observed, though it is said there are no days on Mirandus. The [[Narrative\|Narrative]] outlines a repeating story that keeps occurring with the continuous rise of a [[Dark One (title)\|Dark One]] and an opposing [[Destined One\|Destined One]].

### Narrative
For more information, see [[Narrative\|Narrative]].
