## Plot
The book begins with a character named Raeth who is the eldest son of the emperor of the Imperium but because his aether is weak his younger twin brother Hern was chosen as heir and he was chosen to be a Dari, a form of priest. After the first wave of Forgotten kills both his father and his younger twin brother Hern who is the heir he assumes Hern's persona to keep order in the Imperium. He is forced to confront the mistakes that Hern made and try to win a war against an unknown and incredibly powerful foe. He must contend with the senate as well as those on the war council who Hern offended to try and win the war against the forgotten. He also must keep his identity secret because he will be executed if anyone finds out that he was impersonating an emperor. Raeth must also choose a bride to marry and deal with the brides who are actively competing for his hand. During the struggle of the first battle with the forgotten, he gets touched with a drop from the pool of the forgotten which both strengthens his aether and makes a mysterious voice in his head appear."Aether" was a term used as part of the magic system.

## Publication History
### Original Version
The original version of the book was abandoned, as Brandon felt that it didn't strike a consistent tone between the almost Shakespearean comedy aspects and the utter destruction of the world. As a result, elements were incorporated into later works, such as "Decay" becoming the [[Shard\|Shard]] [[Ruin\|Ruin]] in the [[Mistborn series\|Mistborn series]]. An attempt was also made to adapt the aethers into *[[The Liar of Partinel\|The Liar of Partinel]]*, but that was abandoned. Brandon has also mentioned incorporating a character named Darro into a potential *[[Warbreaker\|Warbreaker]]* sequel named *[[Nightblood (book)\|Nightblood]]*.
Since the draft version of *Aether of Night* is unlikely ever to be published, Brandon's team used to send a copy to people who requested it via email, provided that they agreed not to share it or discuss it on public forums. As of July 2017, Brandon gave the file to the  to distribute. They will send out the file after it is requested; however, the wait can still be several weeks due to high demand.

### Potential Rewrite
It remains likely that an aether-centric book or series will be published in some form, but it would be a complete rewrite. Brandon has mentioned that the general mechanics of the magic system would be retained.
A substance called "[[Aether\|aether]]" appeared in *[[Oathbringer\|Oathbringer]]*, and in *[[Rhythm of War\|Rhythm of War]]*, leaving the door open for the story to take place in the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]]. Aethers were then fully introduced in *[[The Lost Metal\|The Lost Metal]]*, with the character [[Prasanva\|Prasanva]] actively using aether magic. Brandon also canonized the name of the aether home planet, [[Dhatri\|Dhatri]].
Brandon continues to list an aether series in his annual [[State of the Sanderson\|State of the Sanderson]] posts. The appearance of an [[Aetherbound\|aetherbound]] in *The Lost Metal* as well as the presence of [[Aether spores\|aether spores]] in *[[Tress of the Emerald Sea\|Tress of the Emerald Sea]]* indicate that Brandon remains interested in expanding on his original concepts from *Aether of Night*. However, this work is not high on his priority list, since aether stories fall outside of the "main" cosmere series.
