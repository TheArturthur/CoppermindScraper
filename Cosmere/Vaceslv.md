## Appearance and Personality
Kaladin describes Vaceslv as a friendly man; [[Alethi\|Alethi]], but with obvious [[Thaylen\|Thaylen]] heritage. Vaceslv is of the tenth [[Dahn\|dahn]], the lowest rank of [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]], and views 'middlers'—lighteyes who are of at least the eighth dahn but not quite highlords—as useless. During a patrol, when Vaceslv's group passes [[Adolin\|Adolin]], who is disguised as a middler, Vaceslv mocks the stereotypical middler desire for fancy clothing.

## Abilities
Vaceslv is trained in using a side sword, truncheon, and small round shield while on patrol. He is also trained in the use of a tower shield and pike in a defensive formation.

## History
Vaceslv came to know Kaladin as a fellow soldier in his squad. Vaceslv and another member named [[Alaward\|Alaward]] tried multiple times to get Kaladin to play cards with them; Kaladin declined, thinking of his experiences with [[Sah\|Sah]] and the other [[Voidbringers\|Voidbringers]].
After a raid by the [[Fused\|Fused]], Vaceslv was noted as having taken a gash to the chest that required assistance from surgeons, but he was able to recover. Noro's squad, likely including Vaceslv, was present when Highmarshal [[Azure\|Azure]] revealed how she supplied food for the army.
Vaceslv followed Kaladin into [[Kholinar Palace\|Kholinar Palace]] with his squad and fought in the [[/wiki/Siege of Kholinar#Battle of Kholinar Palace]]. Most of his squadmates, including Noro and [[Beard\|Beard]], were killed in the fighting. There were a few survivors, but Vaceslv is not mentioned as being one of them, and may have died in the battle.
