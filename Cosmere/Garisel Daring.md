**Garisel Daring** is an accountant at [[Call and Son and Daughters Accounting and Estate\|Call and Son and Daughters Accounting and Estate]] in [[Elendel\|Elendel]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. He is assigned to [[Wayne\|Wayne's]] account as a wealth manager.

## Appearance and Personality
He is tall, and usually wears a bowler hat and a suit with a vest. He has a professional air, and Wayne pejoratively refers to him as "Tall Boring Guy". According to his colleague Mister [[Call\|Call]], Garisel has a girlfriend and women find him attractive.

## History
In 348 [[Catacendre\|PC]], Garisel and Call were the managers of Wayne's finances. However, Wayne found them boring and hated talking about money, so he would constantly try to avoid them. The accountants repeatedly asked [[Reddi\|Reddi]] where to find Wayne; Reddi assumed they were trying to collect on a debt. In fact, Wayne had secretly amassed a fortune of over twenty million [[Boxing\|boxings]] in cash equivalents and another one hundred million in equity. He had made a series of successful investments in the technology and housing sectors, using [[Aluminum\|aluminum]] as collateral. The accounting firm also kept Wayne's stock of [[Bendalloy\|bendalloy]] at their office.
Garisel and Call eventually tracked Wayne down and tried to get him to diversify his portfolio to mitigate risk. They persuaded Wayne to come to their office and "traded" him a hat and glasses to get him to review his ledgers. Wayne came up with the idea of starting a professional [[Noseball\|noseball]] league in Elendel, including building expensive arenas in each octant. Wayne thought this idea would actually lose him money, but Garisel saw potential and began planning for it immediately. Wayne generally refused to discuss other aspects of his portfolio except for a few special requests.
After Wayne's death, Garisel and Call became the executors of his estate. They met with [[Allriandre\|Allriandre]], who was the primary beneficiary of his will. They also met with [[Jaxy\|Jaxy]] to give her funding to renovate [[Ranette\|Ranette's]] shop. They presumably gave [[Marasi\|Marasi]] Wayne's lucky hat, and they were likely involved in setting up a long-running series of joke items that Wayne "bequeathed" to [[Wax\|Wax]].
