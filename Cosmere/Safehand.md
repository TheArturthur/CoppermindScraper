**Safehand** is a [[Roshar\|Rosharan]] term for a woman's left hand. According to cultural tradition in the [[Vorin\|Vorin]] kingdoms, it is improper for a woman to leave her safehand uncovered. A woman's right hand is often referred to as their **freehand**.

## Background and Observance
The modern view on safehands derives from the ancient book *[[Arts and Majesty\|Arts and Majesty]]*, which claimed that "true" feminine pursuits and arts were the ones that could be performed with one hand, while "manly" arts were the ones performed with two hands, thus tying delicacy with women and brute force with men.

The tradition of covering one's safehand is primarily practiced by women in the Vorin nations of [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]], [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]], [[Kharbranth\|Kharbranth]], [[New Natanan\|New Natanan]], and [[Thaylenah\|Thaylenah]]. Girls begin covering their left hand at around twelve years of age, and it is seen as a rite of passage. It is kept hidden from view whenever possible, even when wearing a robe in front of bathing attendants before actually entering the bath. Only family members are touched with a covered safehand, as it is considered to be a fairly intimate gesture. Intentionally showing your safehand is considered an exceptionally private act, usually reserved only for a woman's significant other.
Covering the left hand is not thought of as a major inconvenience among Alethi and Veden nobility, since [[Lighteyes\|lighteyed]] women are able to pursue one-handed hobbies such as painting and writing. Among the upper class, the most common method of covering the safehand is by wearing a [[Havah\|havah]], a traditional dress that includes an oversized sleeve that loosely covers the left hand. The fabric used to make havahs is thin enough that the safehand can still be used to grip things. The sleeve often has a compartment or button where a "safepouch" that holds personal objects can be placed. The pouch may hold objects as large as a notebook, and can usually be transferred between different garments. It is considered extremely rude to open another woman's safepouch. The sleeve typically has a button that can be opened if a woman is in a situation where she can reveal her safehand. Havahs are particularly popular in Alethkar and Jah Keved, and new styles are often introduced in Roshar's fashion capitals of [[Liafor\|Liafor]] and [[Yezier\|Yezier]]. People from non-Vorin nations who associate with Alethi nobility (such as [[Evi\|Evi]] and [[Palona\|Palona]]) are expected to cover their safehands, although they may be relatively careless about keeping it totally hidden.
[[Darkeyes\|Darkeyed]] women often choose to wear a glove instead of a sleeve; they are not concerned about putting on airs and are more likely to need both hands to perform their jobs or household duties. [[Thaylen\|Thaylen]] women, who are less devout than the Alethi and come from a society of sailors, also typically wear gloves. Gloves are considered less modest than sleeves.
Prostitutes may wear fingerless gloves or leave their safehands completely uncovered in order to be provocative and show others who they are before being hired out.

## History
Although *Arts and Majesty* was written prior to the [[Recreance\|Recreance]], it came to prominence after that event when it was adopted as a misogynistic justification for men to bear [[Shardblade\|Shardblades]] and [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]] instead of women. This had far-reaching effects in Vorin society, including women appropriating the duties of reading and writing as a form of retaliation. This change occurred relatively rapidly, over the course of a few decades, and persisted for several millenia.
[[Singer\|Singers]] that served Vorin masters in [[Slaveform\|slaveform]] prior to the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]] sometimes retained the tradition of covering their safehands after they were freed.
During the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], the importance of safehands seemed to decline among some high-ranking Vorin women. [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]] followed the tradition because it was seen as proper, although she did not actually care about it herself. [[Navani\|Navani]] began wearing a glove more often and felt that wearing a sleeve was burdensome.

## Trivia
According to [[Ben McSweeney\|Ben McSweeney]], it was not originally intended for safehands to become a sexual and nudity taboo. After the release of *[[The Way of Kings\|The Way of Kings]]*, however, fans made the connection themselves and Brandon worked it into the world as a result.
