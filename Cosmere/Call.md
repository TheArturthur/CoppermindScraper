**Mister Call** is an accountant at [[Call and Son and Daughters Accounting and Estate\|Call and Son and Daughters Accounting and Estate]] in [[Elendel\|Elendel]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. He is presumably either the founder or the "Son" in the eponymous name of his accounting firm. He is assigned to [[Wayne\|Wayne's]] account as a wealth manager.

## Appearance and Personality
He is relatively short, and he usually wears a bowler hat and a suit with a vest. He wears spectacles, likely for reading. He has a professional air, and Wayne pejoratively refers to him as "Short Boring Guy". He is dating someone.

## History
In 348 [[Catacendre\|PC]], Call and his colleague [[Garisel Daring\|Garisel Daring]] were the managers of Wayne's finances. However, Wayne found them boring and hated talking about money, so he would constantly try to avoid them. The accountants repeatedly asked [[Reddi\|Reddi]] where to find Wayne; Reddi assumed they were trying to collect on a debt. In fact, Wayne had secretly amassed a fortune of over twenty million [[Boxing\|boxings]] in cash equivalents and another one hundred million in equity. He had made a series of successful investments in the technology and housing sectors, using [[Aluminum\|aluminum]] as collateral. The accounting firm also kept Wayne's stock of [[Bendalloy\|bendalloy]] at their office.
Call and Garisel eventually tracked Wayne down and tried to get him to diversify his portfolio to mitigate risk. They persuaded Wayne to come to their office and "traded" him a hat and glasses to get him to review his ledgers. Wayne came up with the idea of starting a professional [[Noseball\|noseball]] league in Elendel and Call noted that it would be expensive to build arenas in each octant. Call also showed him a new convertible from a carmaker named [[Victori\|Victori]], and unsubtly convinced Wayne to invest in the company. Wayne also asked Call to set up payments to [[Allriandre\|Allriandre]], as he had realized that delivering money to her in person helped him more than it helped her. Wayne generally refused to discuss other aspects of his portfolio except for a few special requests.
After Wayne's death, Call and Garisel became the executors of his estate. They met with Allriandre, who was the primary beneficiary of his will. They also met with [[Jaxy\|Jaxy]] to give her funding to renovate [[Ranette\|Ranette's]] shop. They presumably gave [[Marasi\|Marasi]] Wayne's lucky hat, and they were likely involved in setting up a long-running series of joke items that Wayne "bequeathed" to [[Wax\|Wax]].
