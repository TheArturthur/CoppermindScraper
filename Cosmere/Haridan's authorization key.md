**Haridan's authorization key**, also called an **access disc**, is a modern [[Scadrian\|Scadrian]] device used by lieutenant [[Haridan\|Haridan]], and later the [[Cinder King\|Cinder King]], to gain access into the [[Scadrian research facility\|Scadrian research facility]] on [[Canticle\|Canticle]]. Similar devices are typically used by Scadrian surveyors to broadcast their location and allow them to return into their exploratory starships.

## Design
>“*Plastic key cards were, of course, eschewed by them. They had a fetish for metal.*”
\-Nomad describing Scadrians' penchant for using metal[1]

The authorization key is a metal disc slightly smaller than a person's palm. The front face is marked with an odd symbol that [[Nomad\|Nomad]] recognizes as Scadrian in origin. The disc also has Scadrian writing that identifies the original owner's name and rank. Some portion of the key is either carved or etched, leaving grooves on the surface.

## History
### Origin and Theft
[[Haridan\|Haridan]] originally possessed the key and has it on his person when he is killed in a mudslide. The key is discovered along with Haridan's body by one of the [[Cinder King\|Cinder King's]] outriders, likely while conducting a search for the entrance to the [[Scadrian research facility\|Scadrian research facility]] (believed at the time to be the entrance to the mythical [[Refuge of Stone\|Refuge of Stone]]). The Cinder King keeps the key in a safe in the cabin on his personal ship and uses the key to access the research facility, negotiating to trade [[Sunheart\|sunhearts]] for advanced technology and information with which he cements his rule on the planet.
Believing that the Cinder King had not yet determined how to use the key, [[Elegy Salvage\|Elegy Salvage]] devises a plan to steal the disc and use it to seek sanctuary in the Refuge for the people of [[Beacon\|Beacon]]. After Elegy and other citizens of [[Beacon\|Beacon]] are captured, the [[Greater Good\|Greater Good]] task [[Zeal\|Zeal]] with mounting a rescue mission and using the rescue as a cover to steal the authorization key and swap it with a replica. Zeal and his team successfully complete their mission and bring the key with them back to Beacon wrapped in a handkerchief.

### Beacon
On Beacon, [[Contemplation\|Contemplation]] and [[Compassion\|Compassion]] are excited at the prospect of having the key, the latter commending Zeal's team for their willingness to steal the device. However, [[Confidence\|Confidence]] is more wary, cautioning that the key might be a fake and warning that the Cinder King will chase them for taking it. Zeal argues that the Cinder King would have had no cause to create a fake as he trusts in his unquestioned authority and believes few people know about his use of the key. Compassion adds that the Cinder King would now chase them anyways for publicly challenging his authority. [[Rebeke Salvage\|Rebeke Salvage]] is jubilant at the disc's theft, remarking that it is Elegy's plan and Beacon's only path to freedom. The Greater Good decides to follow through with the plan and attempt to use the key to open the Refuge.
[[Nomad\|Nomad]] informs the Beaconites that he knows what the disk is and asks if they know where the door it opens is located. Compassion replies that they have some idea and adds that it was Elegy's plan to steal the key and then figure out how to use it. Nomad reads the disk, telling the Beaconites that it originally belonged to a lieutenant named Haridan. [[Jeffrey Jeffrey\|Jeffrey Jeffrey]] asks for assurance that Nomad can activate the key, explaining (erroneously), that the Cinder King had tried for years but had never been successful. Contemplation worries about Nomad taking risks that endanger his life as if he dies, he will not be able to use the key for them.
While parleying with Nomad on his luxury ship the Cinder King is informed by a scout that the Beaconites are searching the area for the Refuge and figures out that they have swapped his key for a fake.

### Research Facility
At the entrance to the Scadrian research facility, Zeal hands Nomad (now named Zellion) the key but he tosses it back, seemingly not needing it to open the door. Zellion instead invokes the Refugee and Lost Expatriate Bill of [[Silverlight Codes of Interplanetary Conduct\|Silverlight Codes of Interplanetary Conduct]] and formally requests asylum for himself and the people of Beacon.
