## Attributes and abilities
Shashara is a [[Returned\|Returned]]. As such she can have the fifth [[Heightening\|Heightening]] whenever she wants. This includes all the abilities granted by it, such as agelessness. She held the ninth [[Heightening\|Heightening]] at least once, using it to make [[Nightblood\|Nightblood]].
As one of the [[Five Scholars\|Five Scholars]] Shashara has a good understanding of [[Awakening\|Awakening]], and has made several discoveries. It is also likely she can use her [[Divine Breath\|divine Breath]] to alter her appearance, as the other scholars have been seen doing this.
As she is known to have wielded [[Nightblood\|Nightblood]] she was probably bonded to him. This makes her resistant to the effects caused by Nightblood.
As her brother [[VaraTreledees\|VaraTreledees]] had the [[Royal Locks\|Royal Locks]] it’s safe to assume she had them as well.

## History
### Early life and Returning
Shashara's life before she Returned is a mystery. She had a brother however, who would later return as [[VaraTreledees\|VaraTreledees]]. At some point she died.
Upon her Return, she was found and taken in by the [[Cult of the Returned\|Cult of the Returned]]. They gave her the name **Glorysinger**. At some point she and four others, [[VaraTreledees\|VaraTreledees]], [[Talaxin\|Talaxin]], [[Arsteel\|Arsteel]], and [[Yesteel\|Yesteel]] formed the [[Five Scholars\|Five Scholars]]. During this time she researched [[Awakening\|Awakening]], becoming one of the most talented Awakeners of the Five Scholars. She did multiple notable inventions during this time, known examples being the creation of the one-Breath [[/wiki/Awakening#Awakening Commands]] to create [[Lifeless\|Lifeless]] and also the discovery of how to create a sentient Awakened object of steel, leading to the creation of [[Nightblood\|Nightblood]].
Sometime after her first death she traveled the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]].
During this time Talaxin and Shashara fell in love, and eventually married. Talaxin and Shashara collaborated on their Awakening research. Shashara and Talaxin, or Vasher, worked together to create the Command for Nightblood, "Destroy evil." After Nightblood's creation she argued with [[Talaxin\|Talaxin]], claiming the sword could be a poet or a scholar, like a man.

### The Manywar and Death
After the [[Manywar\|Manywar]] began, the [[Five Scholars\|Five Scholars]] split and joined different sides, Shashara joined Talaxin on the side of [[Hanald\|Hanald]] and eventually she and Talaxin convinced her brother to join them as well. During this war she and Talaxin provided Hanald with information and techniques regarding Awakening. She might have also been a general, as she’s known to have fought at least once.
Shashara participated in the [[Battle of Twilight Falls\|Battle of Twilight Falls]], here she drew Nightblood, killing many soldiers. While the exact details of the Battle of Twilight Falls have yet to be revealed, Talaxin was horrified by what happened.
Shortly after this event Shashara told Talaxin that she wanted to reveal how metal could be Awakened, possibly leading to more swords like Nightblood. This sparked a massive argument between them, only ending when Talaxin slew her with Nightblood in order to prevent more deaths.

## Legacy
Due to Shashara's death, [[VaraTreledees\|VaraTreledees]] developed a hate for [[Talaxin\|Talaxin]], which would only end with his death during the [[Pahn Kahl rebellion\|Pahn Kahl rebellion]].
[[Nightblood\|Nightblood's]] first memories are very important to him, and cannot be overwritten. Due to this he always thinks of Shashara as alive.
She is considered an early [[Cosmere\|cosmere]] scholar by those at [[Silverlight\|Silverlight]].

## Trivia
Shashara was not known to have worn red scarves. This strongly implies that she was not the person who inspired the story of [[The Girl Who Looked Up\|The Girl Who Looked Up]].
There is no significance with Shashara's name bearing a close resemblance to the [[Herald\|Herald]] [[Shalash\|Shalash's]] name.
