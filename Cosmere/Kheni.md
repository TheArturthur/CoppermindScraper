**Kheni** is a poor mother who lives in [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] after the coming of the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]]. She may be a human or a singer; it is unknown at this time. She is married to [[Cob (Stormlight)\|Cob]] and had a young child who was killed either during or before the fall of the city.
After her child is killed, Kheni goes into a catatonic state, staring blankly while holding onto an empty cradle. Though she may seem to not be aware of her surroundings, often remaining silent when spoken to and giving no visual signs of understanding, she does listen to those who speak to her. Her condition worries her husband greatly and he will often hover close to his wife.
[[Hoid\|Hoid]] befriends the couple while spending time disguised in Kholinar by the [[Fused\|Fused]] and other [[Singer\|singers]]. He visits Kheni before departing the city, suggesting different bodily alterations he could give himself to try and provoke a reaction from the women. Hoid finds a young girl who has been orphaned and brings her to Kheni and Cob so that they can take care of her, which seems to cause Kheni to begin to regain her senses.
