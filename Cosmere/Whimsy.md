## Intent
Very little is known about Whimsy's Intent, outside it not being congruous with intense planning and ambitions. It is also not calculating nor deliberate.

## History
Like all Shards, Whimsy was created at the [[Shattering\|Shattering]] of [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]], and picked up by an unknown Vessel. It is not known what Whimsy did directly after their Ascension, or where they settled, if they settled at all.
Some time around the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], [[Harmony\|Harmony]], by [[Hoid\|Hoid's]] request, reached out to Whimsy about the threat posed by [[Odium\|Odium]], but their exchange left him with the impression that Whimsy would not be particularly useful. Members of the [[Set\|Set]] were aware of the existence of Whimsy.

## Trivia
