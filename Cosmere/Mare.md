She is also active in the skaa rebellion. She and Kelsier are captured by the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]] when they try to infiltrate [[Kredik Shaw\|Kredik Shaw]], and sent to the [[Pits of Hathsin\|Pits of Hathsin]].

## Appearance and Personality
 by  Shuravf 
For more images, see [[Mare/Gallery\|/Gallery]].
Mare has dark hair and a stubborn personality. Kelsier describes her as having had 'a hidden streak of unconventionality'.

## Attributes and Abilities
### Allomancy
Mare is a [[Tineye\|Tineye]], meaning she can burn tin to enhance her senses.

### Thieving
Mare is a competent thief, working with Kelsier and Dockson as well as other thieves. She is also very skilled at impersonating a noblewoman.

## History
Mare was drawn to the Skaa underground because of both her status as a skaa [[Misting\|Misting]] and her interest in pre-Ascension times. This was how she met Kelsier. They got married, although [[Marsh\|Marsh]] had also been in love with her. Mare was also friends with [[Sazed\|Sazed]], and introduced him to her husband.

She wanted children, particularly a daughter whom she could teach to ‘walk the line between noblewoman and thief’. However, Kelsier thought they would be a hindrance and so they had none — something he later regretted.
She expressed disappointment when Kelsier's vigilante actions against nobles would throw their life into upheaval.
When Kelsier heard that the Lord Ruler was hiding something valuable in his secret room, Mare and a [[Smoker\|Smoker]] named [[Redd\|Redd]] helped him in his attempt to break into the room. However, they arrived to find [[Steel Inquisitors\|Steel Inquisitors]] outside the secret chamber, waiting for them. They killed Redd immediately. The Lord Ruler then thanked Mare for betraying Kelsier to him, before the two were separated.
She arrived in the Pits of Hathsin a few weeks after Kelsier. Though he still loved her, Kelsier questioned her loyalty due to the Lord Ruler's words. Despite Mare's claims of innocence, Kelsier believed the lie that Mare had betrayed him, although he was never completely certain about what had happened. She died eighteen months later, having sacrificed herself for Kelsier. He had been unable to find an [[Atium\|atium]] geode, without which he would have been killed by the taskmasters. Mare convinced him to take hers, lying that she had found two that week. When it was revealed that she had none, the taskmasters beat her to death. This event is what caused Kelsier to [[Snap\|Snap]].
[[Preservation\|Preservation]] informed Kelsier that Mare went to the [[Beyond\|Beyond]] after her death. Kelsier later sought to confirm this, but received no answer from the [[Shard\|Shard]]. However, Mare was not a [[Kandra\|kandra]], nor does she exist as a [[Cognitive Shadow\|Cognitive Shadow]].

## Legacy

Years later, [[Vin\|Vin]] realized that the Lord Ruler and his Inquisitors were able to pierce [[Copper\|copperclouds]]. She concluded that the Inquisitors had sensed Mare's use of Allomancy on the night of the break-in, allowing them to apprehend Kelsier's small team. This meant that it was possible that Mare hadn't betrayed Kelsier after all, although Kelsier struggled to process this new information.
[[Marewill flowers\|Marewill flowers]] that grow in post-[[Catacendre\|Catacendre]] Scadrial were named after Mare by [[Spook\|Spook]].

## Trivia
Some aspects of Mare's life and her backstory with Kelsier remain mysterious, but may be explained in a future story such as a sequel to *Mistborn: Secret History*.
