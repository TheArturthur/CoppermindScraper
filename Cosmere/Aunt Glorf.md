**Aunt Glorf** Is a resident of [[Diggen's Point\|Diggen's Point]] on [[Lumar\|Lumar]]. She is [[Tress\|Tress']] aunt, and best known for her desire to fight for the best deals in the market, as she'd been afraid of looking silly, by being taken advantage of. Similar to [[Fort\|Fort]] she would bargain fiercely for even the smallest of items.
