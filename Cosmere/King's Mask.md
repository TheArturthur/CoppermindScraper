A **King's Mask** is a member of a secret assassin group for the [[Verdant King\|Verdant King]] on [[Lumar\|Lumar]]; it is unclear if the role actually exists or is just part of folklore.
They serve as assassins and spies for the king, and are said to never be allowed to say if they are one. They are also said to take youth potions in order to mask their true ages and better their disguises, as they are meant to appear innocent. It is believed that there are only ever five at at time. They are thought to be in a position that they can vouch for others to the king.
Some members of the [[Crow's Song\|Crow's Song]] mistook [[Tress\|Tress]] for a King's Mask.
