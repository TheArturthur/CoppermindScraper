**Harmony** is the name taken by [[Sazed\|Sazed]] after the [[Final Ascension\|Final Ascension]] and his acquisition of the [[Shard\|Shards]] [[Ruin\|Ruin]] and [[Preservation\|Preservation]] as he felt it fit the Shard. With the opposing forces of Preservation and Ruin both Invested within him, balance and Harmony is achieved. Three hundred years post-[[Catacendre\|Catacendre]] the name is in widespread use by the inhabitants of the [[Elendel Basin\|Elendel Basin]] and the surrounding [[Roughs\|Roughs]].
His [[Perpendicularity\|perpendicularity]] is in an uncertain location in the far south, it is under careful control, supposedly by the [[Malwish\|Malwish]]. Because Harmony has two Shards, he is considered to be the most [[Invest\|Invested]] being in the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]].

## Intent
  The dual aspects of Harmony and Discord
### Harmony
>“*The point is Harmony, creating a way for as many as possible to make their own choices.*”
\-Harmony's stated interest[6]


Harmony's Intent relates to giving as many people as possible the ability to make their own decisions and choices. This freedom includes the capacity for both acts of goodness, and acts of evil and destruction; because restricting such a capacity goes against Harmony's Intent.
At one point he seems to indicate that his natural inclination as a former human being towards Preservation is somehow separate from his need as Harmony to balance the two forces. If Sazed had been unable to balance the two powers, the Shard's name would be different. In his response to one of [[Hoid\|Hoid's]] [[Letters\|letters]] he states that the Shards he holds are in such conflict that even simple actions are difficult. [[Odium\|Odium]] is scared of Harmony, as he represents the possibility that two Shards can merge and, by being in harmony, become more powerful.
Although Harmony promotes free will, he is not beyond causing or allowing interference, as evident from having [[Ironeyes\|Ironeyes]] act as his agent, and communicating to [[Waxillium\|Waxillium]] through an earring. He also controls the [[Kandra\|kandra]], which act as his agents, until he releases them at an unknown point.

### Discord
>“*His name shall be Discord, yet they shall love him for it.*”
\-Excerpt from the Terris Prophecies of the Hero of Ages[13]


If Sazed was less in control of the conflict between the two halves of Harmony, the Shard's Intent could shift from Harmony to Discord. The difference between these two Intents is related to the rhythms and pure tones of Ruin and Preservation and how they respond to each other; in Harmony, they are working together, but in Discord they would not be doing so. By 348 [[Catacendre\|PC]], a dark and shadowy double sometimes appears behind Harmony, which [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] calls "a representation of his other self." Kelsier also stated that Ruin had always been more powerful, indicating that Ruin would be more in control than Preservation in Discord. [[Telsin Ladrian\|Telsin Ladrian]], an avatar of [[Autonomy\|Autonomy]], believes that part of the reason Harmony pushed to make [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]] his sword was because Harmony knew he would become Discord soon.

## Associated magic
 
Harmony holds both the shards Preservation and Ruin, and they have become intermingled. If Sazed were to die, the shard left behind would be Harmony (this supposedly would also apply to Discord, if he changes), not Ruin and Preservation separately. It would require effort to split them back up again.

### Metallic Arts
For more information, see [[Metallic Arts\|Metallic Arts]].
The [[Metallic Arts\|Metallic Arts]] of Ruin and Preservation are still associated with their Shards, and thus with Harmony. No new magic systems are known to have come from Harmony.

### Harmonium
For more information, see [[Harmonium\|Harmonium]].
[[Harmonium\|Harmonium]], also known as Ettmetal, is the [[God Metal\|God Metal]] associated with Harmony. Due to the merging of [[Ruin\|Ruin]] and [[Preservation\|Preservation's]] [[Shard\|intents]] into Harmony, ettmetal's [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual aspect]] is in opposition with itself, leading to effects on the metal's [[Physical Realm\|Physical aspect]], which makes it extremely reactive. It reacts violently with water, similar to . Alloying [[Atium\|atium]] and [[Lerasium\|lerasium]] will not give harmonium.
It reacts in an especially violent manner when heated and made to interact with [[Trellium\|Trellium]], converting part of the metal directly into energy in a powerful explosion. Not even Harmony fully understands how powerful these explosions can be. This, with the proper intent, produces small amounts of atium and lerasium.

### Mists
  Harmony
For more information, see [[Mist\|Mist]].
The [[Mist\|mist]] of Scadrial is the gaseous form of Harmony's [[Investiture\|Investiture]]. After [[Sazed\|Sazed]] picked up both [[Shard\|Shards]], becoming Harmony, more than one type of mist began appearing, and the mists no longer obscured the land every night. There are now two types of mists: a darker mist representing Ruin and a lighter mist representing Preservation. Where there are mists, Harmony can more directly influence things.
The mists sent forth by Harmony are capable of powering both [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]] and [[Feruchemy\|Feruchemy]], and they no longer pull away from [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgy]]. However, as of 348 [[Catacendre\|PC]], this is no longer the case and mists once again pull away from Hemalurgy. This change is likely tied to Harmony's rapid descent towards Discord.
If a person is in the mists, Harmony can give them impressions of their memories.

### Direct intervention
Being both of the Shards that directly created [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]], Harmony can rearrange continents, recreate extinct forms of life, and even move the planet within the solar system, permanently changing its orbit. Additionally, Preservation is Invested in every Scadrian, and can alter the way their bodies function. Harmony can also read and alter any text not written in metal. Although this likely has become more difficult as his Intent influenced him more and more over time.
Harmony has the ability to speak to, and read the thoughts of any person with a [[Hemalurgic\|Hemalurgic]] spike. He gains the ability to hear from Preservation and the ability to speak from Ruin, mentioning that he found it interesting that while separate one could only hear and the other only speak. It can manifest a body in Scadrial's [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]], which [[Sazed\|Sazed]] uses to speak with the recently-deceased before they pass on through to the [[Beyond\|Beyond]], he is likely able to manifest multiple bodies which can act independently, like Leras before him, though this isn't confirmed. He occasionally has [[Marsh\|Marsh]] do this job for him.
As time went on and he became more and more affected by his Intent and the conflict between his Shards, Harmony found it more and more difficult to actually take any meaningful action, causing him to rely more and more upon agents to bring forth change in the world.

### Catacendre
  Harmony
>“*By the forgotten Gods!*”
\-Sazed's reaction upon realizing the Terris prophecies referred to him[33]


After taking up the powers of both Ruin and Preservation at Final Ascension, Sazed proceeded to repair the damage wrought upon [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]] by Ruin, and the clumsy efforts of [[Vin\|Vin]] and [[Rashek\|Rashek]] to repair the world. He accomplished this by using the information stored in his [[Coppermind\|copperminds]], which contained references to what [[Classical Scadrial\|Classical Scadrial]] was like. Unhindered by another [[Shard\|Shard]] opposing his every action and limiting what he could do, he was able to restore Scadrial to the planet that existed prior to Rashek's ascension. Using the power of the Shards, he was also able to change the [[Koloss\|koloss]] into a true breeding race.
After his Ascension, Sazed began working to understand the nature of the cosmere, though there are forces working to limit his knowledge.
In order to help humanity rebuild, he created an extremely fertile basin known as [[Elendel Basin\|Elendel Basin]], and granted them extensive records on history, science, religion, city planning, and so forth known as the [[Words of Founding\|Words of Founding]]. These documents did much to help humanity, and became holy documents to a religion that grew around the newborn god, [[The Path\|The Path]], which came to be one of the most significant religions in the new world.

### Letters to Hoid
At some point around three centuries after Sazed's Ascension, Harmony received a letter from [[Hoid\|Hoid]] asking for help dealing with [[Odium\|Odium]]. He wrote [[/wiki/Letters#Third Oathbringer Letter]], in which he expressed surprise at some of the information Hoid shared and explained that the conflicting nature of Ruin and Preservation made it hard to act. He also expressed a reluctance to help Hoid as they had never met and Hoid had hid himself before while visiting Scadrial, but agreed to consider the matter further if Hoid visited him openly.
Some time later, Harmony wrote [[/wiki/Letters#The Sixth Letter]] to Hoid, detailing his attempts to contact other Shards and sharing his concerns about both the damage Odium had already done and about other Shards he could not sense potentially encroaching on Scadrial. In response to these threats, he wrote that he was hoping to find a person to act as his "sword," someone who could act on his behalf when the conflicting nature of Ruin and Preservation make it near-impossible for him to act directly, and asked Hoid to do his best to maintain Odium's prison until other Shards could be convinced to act and a plan could be made.

  Speaking to <<Wax\|Wax>> and showing him <<Trell (Trellism)\|Trell's>> red mist
### Arrival of Trell
The Shard he detected encroaching upon Scadrial turned out to be [[Autonomy\|Autonomy]], who claimed the planet for themselves and their [[/wiki/Shard#Creating Sapience]].
Harmony indirectly used [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]], his sword, by way of his [[Wax's earring\|earring]] as a pawn, doing his work in the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]], such as fighting against various figures and cults which sought to help Autonomy take over the planet, such as The [[Set\|Set]]. He assigned the [[Kandra\|kandra]] [[Paalm\|Paalm]] to play the human Lessie and protect Wax during his time as a lawman in the [[Roughs\|Roughs]]. Paalm eventually removed one of her [[Blessing\|spikes]] to avoid Harmony's control. She took the alias of Bleeder and attempted to overthrow Harmony's control of mankind. She was stopped by Wax who fired a [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgic]] bullet into her skull, allowing Harmony to regain control of her. Wax learned of Harmony's manipulation and felt used.
Later on, the kandra [[VenDell\|VenDell]] and [[MeLaan\|MeLaan]] implied that Harmony was getting distracted and were worried that something bad was happening on Scadrial. Sazed confirmed this to Wax during their conversation after his temporary death, showing him a red glow around the planet from some unknown hostile force. Wax confronted Harmony about his interference and lack of assistance. Harmony explained that he could not always intervene because mankind would only ask for more help and always be dissatisfied. He gave Wax the option of moving on to the Beyond or going back, and Wax chose to go back.
At some point before this, he became unstable and his [[Intent\|Intent]] began to shift towards Discord. This is shown through the manifestation of a shadowy reflection of Harmony which closely follows him. Telsin, a burgeoning Avatar of Autonomy, believed that Harmony choose Wax as his Sword because he knew that he would eventually become Discord, this suggests that he was starting to fall beforehand, as he began to look for a sword many years before.
Around 348 PC, he was forcibly Invested by Autonomy, and through this blinded. This, along with his knowledge of the harmonium-trellium bomb that the Set have discovered and the formation of an Avatar of Autonomy on Scadrial, led him to requesting Wax to once again become his Sword, a request to which he agreed.
He spoke to and stood by Wayne as he tried to stop the Set's bomb from destroying Elendel. Following Wayne's death from the explosion, he presented himself to him in the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]] as he began to be pulled into the [[Beyond\|Beyond]], having a conversation and answering his questions before he disappeared forever.
Three weeks later, he had a meeting with Kelsier concerning Autonomy, technological advancement, and how to create an army of [[Allomancer\|Allomancers]] in order to fight off the Shard's army. Though he vehemently disagreed with his friend's intended methods, and with his wishes for Harmony to give his knowledge to humanity to bring about advancement like have been seen on [[Taldain\|Taldain]].
At some point long after the flight of Autonomy, he survived and remained as the Vessel of a Shard (albeit whether it is of Harmony or Discord is currently unknown), and he released the kandra and allowed them to wander the cosmere. The exact point at which this happened is unknown.
