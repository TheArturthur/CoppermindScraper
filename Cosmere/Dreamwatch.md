The **Dreamwatch** is a prestigious, elite force of [[Nightmare\|nightmare]] [[Painter\|painters]], tasked with the responsibility of handling stable nightmares. Full members of the Dreamwatch, called the **central soldier**, assemble and lead their own team of painters, called their **companions**. The Dreamwatch are highly regarded and well paid for their artistic ability and the service they perform.
Nightmare painters typically report sightings or signs of stable nightmares to their foreman, who in turn forwards the report to the Dreamwatch. The Dreamwatch travel from town to town as needed, and are supplied with living arrangements befitting their station. Members are selected one year into their training, and afterwards train separately for an additional year. Though admittance into the Dreamwatch is supposedly based on merit, the role is an appointed position in practice. Rampant nepotism makes it nearly impossible for any painter to join their ranks without wealth, political influence, or family connections.

## History
[[Nikaro\|Nikaro]] attempted to join the Dreamwatch while in school, but he was rejected. A contingent of the Dreamwatch was summoned to [[Kilahito\|Kilahito]] from [[Jito\|Jito]] after [[Tojin\|Tojin]] reported [[Liyun\|the stable nightmare]] previously encountered by Nikaro. After their arrival, Nikaro attempted to warn them of an incoming army of stable nightmares. He found them lounging in their headquarters, acting with no urgency with regard to a previously reported nightmare. They took his statement but otherwise did not give his word any credence. As a result, the Dreamwatch missed the [[Battle of Kilahito\|battle of Kilahito]]. During that assault, painters led by Nikaro used the battle cry "We are the Dreamwatch now!" After the battle the Dreamwatch was disbanded, along with the rest of the nightmare painter profession.
