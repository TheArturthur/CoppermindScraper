>“*Eddie Macano died in that skirmish with the underbloods two days back. I was there...*”
\-Curveball[1]


The **underbloods** are a group of people in [[Newcago\|Newcago]]; possibly a gang, or servants of some [[Epic\|Epic]] from another city. They seem to be opposed to [[Steelheart\|Steelheart's]] regime, as [[Curveball\|Curveball]] and his underlings fight with them occasionally.
The underbloods kill one of Curveball's men, [[Eddie Macano\|Eddie Macano]], two days before [[David\|David]] attempts to blend in by pretending to be on site on orders from Eddie. David isn't aware of that, which blows his cover.
