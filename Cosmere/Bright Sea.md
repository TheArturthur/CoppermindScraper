## Etymology
The Bright Sea is its original name. Since [[Idris\|Idris]] split from [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]], Idrians call the sea the **Inner Sea**, to downplay its importance, since Idris was landlocked. Idris and Hallandren usually have different names for geographical features, due to the bad blood between them. However, in many cases, both names stuck, so Inner Sea and Bright Sea are used interchangeably by many.

## Geography and Ecology

There many nations located on its shores. The most powerful of these nations is called [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]]. Hallandren is located on the western shore of the Sea, this nation controls a good third of the coastline, as well as some islands. Tedradel is also located on it’s shore. The location of Tedradel is described as across the Bright Sea from Hallandren, which makes it lie somewhere in the east.

## Cultural influence and Trade

T’Telir is the largest city to sell the valuable [[Tears of Edgli\|Tears of Edgli]], bringing it extreme wealth.
[[Hallandren\|Hallandren]] has a number of [[Stormrunners\|Stormrunners]] that sail the Bright Sea during the spring storms. The Bright Sea also plays a large role in why [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]] has become the economic powerhouse it is at the time of the [[Pahn Kahl rebellion\|Pahn Kahl rebellion]].
