>“*And if you let a man die with too Invested a soul—or Invest him right as he’s dying—he’ll leave behind a shadow you can nail back onto a body.*”
\-Zahel’s description of a Cognitive Shadow[1]


**Cognitive Shadow**, also known as a **Type Two Invested entity**, is a term used to refer to a spirit that has not yet moved into the afterlife. While the manifestations of this kind of entity can vary depending on the [[Shardworld\|world]] it occurs on, Cognitive Shadows can occur on any planet in the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]].

## Mechanics
Cognitive Shadows can be created by a variety of processes. Some of them are created when a person has sufficient attachment to something in the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]]. When a [[Vessel\|Vessel]] that has held onto a [[Shard\|Shard]] for a long time dies it becomes a Cognitive Shadow that can continue to act. Depending on how they are made, Cognitive Shadows are sometimes bound to the planetary system they were made on, and are unable to leave it either through the Physical or Cognitive Realm. It is possible to overcome this issue.
The Cognitive aspect of a recently deceased person can become a Cognitive Shadow by finding a source of Investiture to anchor themselves to the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]] before passing on to the [[Beyond\|Beyond]]. The Investiture replaces the parts of the soul that connects it to the Three Realms, providing an anchor for it in the Cognitive Realm. Some [[Vessel\|Vessels]] can prepare a Cognitive Shadow at or just prior to their death or [[Splinter\|Splintering]], allowing a portion of their power to continue to function with a small amount of direction; the [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]] is an example of this.
It is theoretically possible for a Cognitive Shadow to form a [[Nahel bond\|Nahel bond]] with a human. They are not able to burn [[God Metal\|God Metals]]. They may be able to create objects from nothing, if they view it as an extension of themselves and are [[Connection\|Connected]] to them.
Cognitive Shadows look different in the Cognitive Realm, where how they became a Cognitive Shadow will influence how they look. Shards could create a physical body for Cognitive Shadows.

### Destruction
A Cognitive Shadow can be permanently killed by the use of a [[Raysium\|raysium]] dagger touching a gem of anti-Light of the type of [[Investiture\|Investiture]] associated with the Cognitive Shadow. For instance, a raysium dagger with an [[Anti-Voidlight\|anti-Voidlight]] gem can permanently kill a [[Fused\|Fused]], and a Herald can presumably be similarly killed with anti-Stormlight. Cognitive Shadows will turn into [[Sunheart\|sunhearts]] when exposed to the sun on [[Canticle\|Canticle]].
Additionally, Cognitive Shadows can be killed by negating their Connection to all three Realms, a process which destroys the anchor against the pull of the Beyond. The experience is described as having your soul ripped apart.
A Cognitive Shadow can also willingly choose to pass into the Beyond.

### Cognitive Influence
Cognitive Shadows are influenced by how people view them over time, although this takes centuries due to their own strong sense of self. But Cognitive Shadows with less sense of self, or less controlled by another source, are more easily malleable by Cognitive influence. Cognitive Shadows that are normally invisible to people in the Physical Realm can still be seen and heard by people who exist partly in the Cognitive Realm.

## Examples
### Roshar

When the [[Singers\|singers]] turned to [[Odium\|Odium]] for help in fighting off the humans, he responded by infusing some of them with his power, which turned them into Cognitive Shadows. They reside on [[Braize\|Braize]], but return to [[Roshar\|Roshar]] during every [[Desolation\|Desolation]]. Since they lost their bodies long ago, they must possess the bodies of living singers; in doing so they destroy the mind of the possessed body. This cycle of rebirth strains the minds of the Fused and, eventually, they go crazy.Their status as Cognitive Shadows grants them access to the [[Surge\|Surges]]. Odium could remove the Investiture that maintains a Fused, which would send that Fused to the [[Beyond\|Beyond]].


When the Heralds of [[The Almighty\|The Almighty]] took up the [[Oathpact\|Oathpact]], they gained a direct connection to [[Honor\|Honor]]. This connection transformed them into Cognitive Shadows. Each time they return to Roshar, a new body is created for them. Unlike the [[Returned\|Returned]], they do not need to consume Investiture to remain in their bodies.


Prior to Odium's splintering of Honor, the Stormfather was just the [[Spren\|spren]] of the [[Highstorm\|highstorm]] and one of the three [[Bondsmith\|Bondsmith]] spren. After Honor's death, the Cognitive Shadow of its Vessel, [[Tanavast\|Tanavast]], merged with the Stormfather, though it does not appear that the Stormfather has Tanavast's memories.

### Scadrial

>“*Look at you Kelsier! You haven't form or shape. You're not alive, you're an *idea*. A *memory* of a man holding the power will never be as potent as a real one with ties to all three Realms.*”
\-Ruin on Kelsier's Ascension[35]

After his death, Kelsier found the [[Well of Ascension\|Well of Ascension]] in the Cognitive Realm and, with [[Leras\|Leras']] help, merged with it. As a result, he became infused with [[Preservation\|Preservation's]] power and became a , though, since the Well was created as a prison, he was unable to leave. After [[Vin\|Vin]] released [[Ruin\|Ruin]] from the Well he was able to travel the Scadrian Cognitive Realm and influence the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]], though he was unable to actually leave the Cognitve Realm because his "ties to the Physical Realm [had] been severed" by his death. With the help of a device made by the [[Ire\|Ire]], he was able to hold the [[Shard\|Shard]] of Preservation after [[Leras\|Leras]] died, though, according to [[Ruin\|Ruin]], he made for a weaker [[Vessel\|Vessel]] than a normal person. Some time after the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]], [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] found a way to recreate his physical body using [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgy]] and return to the Physical Realm. Upon death, he lost his ability to use [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]] and has not recovered it despite regaining a body.

### Nalthis

When [[Endowment\|Endowment]] Returns someone after death, she uses a [[/wiki/BioChromatic Breath#Type I]] to "staple" the Cognitive Shadow of the deceased person back to that person's body. This process results in the Returned losing any memories of their prior life. Returned must consume one Breath every eight days to fuel their divine Breath. [[Vasher\|Vasher]] states that he is a Type Two Invested Entity because he died while “drenched in power” and left behind a “fossil of a soul”.


If a Lifeless were created with extra Breath, that Breath might start to take on a "personality" like a Cognitive Shadow would have.

### Threnody

Shades are a unique kind of Cognitive Shadow found on [[Threnody\|Threnody]] that are able to interact with the Physical Realm. They are drawn by anyone moving quickly at night, lighting a fire, or drawing blood and their touch withers a person, which usually results in death. Any person or animal killed by a Shade becomes a Shade. It is unknown how the first Shades were created, though, when [[Nazh\|Nazh]] first meets Kelsier, he is shocked that Kelsier managed to become a Cognitive Shadow and says it is "an important rite ... with requirements and traditions." Shades are repelled and can be harmed by silver, though it is unknown whether this applies to other kinds of Cognitive Shadows as well. They also are not as self-aware as normal Cognitive Shadows. If some other Cognitive Shadow traveled to Threnody, he or she would not become a Shade, and if a Shade managed to leave Threnody, it would not be destroyed. Differences between Shades and normal Cognitive Shadows are a result of the nature of the Investiture on Threnody and the lack of a Shard.

### Komashi

Nightmares are former inhabitants of the kingdom of [[Torio\|Torio]], who are kept in servitude under the [[Father machine\|father machine]]. They were killed by the father machine, which absorbed their souls and destroyed their bodies. During the night, the control of the machine over them loosens, and they wander the planet looking for humans for cognitive activity to feed off of. Following the destruction of the father machine and dissolution of the [[Shroud\|shroud]], they dissolved into Investiture and vanished.
They are defended against by [[Painter\|painters]], who are able to force them into more harmless shapes, forcing them to dissolve away into black mist.


The Yoki-hijo reformed after being killed by the father machine due to how heavily Invested they were. The father machine subsequently trapped them in simulations of their former life, constantly erasing their memory, and having them repeat a simulation of the same day ad infinitum.


[[Hijo\|Hijo]] are able to form a Spiritual Connection between two individuals and have them swap bodies with each other. Those linked will swap bodies every day, where one is in control of the other's body while the other is a Cognitive Shadow. This Connection can be forcibly severed, causing the two to no longer swap bodies.

## Trivia
The mist spirit that Vin sees during [[The Well of Ascension\|The Well of Ascension]] is not a Cognitive Shadow. Depending on the scene, it was an actual manifestation of Preservation or Ruin's imitation of that manifestation.
