## Appearance and Personality
Templeton uses the curse "Trell's soul!", which seems to indicate that he is a [[Trell (Trellism)\|Trell]] worshiper.
He has a collection of stuffed albino animals, which he keeps fastidiously neat and arranged. He has been collecting them for some time, occasionally stuffs them himself, and is very familiar with the difference between a specimen that has been bleached and a true albino.

## History
Templeton was tasked by the Set with recovering [[ReLuur\|ReLuur's]] [[Blessing\|spike]] from the mass grave in which it had been buried. He retrieved it and sent it to [[Dulsing\|Dulsing]] via a courier, leaving a note in the graveyard's ledger instructing the gravekeepers to inform him immediately if anyone came asking about the mass grave.
When [[Wayne\|Wayne]] and [[Marasi\|Marasi]] went to the cemetery to look for the spike, they were attacked by hired assassins after [[Dechamp\|Dechamp]] sent to Templeton. Having survived the attack but failed to find the spike, they found Templeton's note in a hidden ledger book in the gravekeeper's shack. They then went to Templeton's house, where Wayne impersonated [[Marsh\|Death]] and used Dechamp's corpse to scare him into revealing the location of the spike. Templeton was subsequently arrested by the New Seran constables based on the evidence of graverobbing found in the ledger.

## Relationships
Templeton lives with a skinny and worn woman named [[Destra\|Destra]] who is nervous around him. It is implied that they are in a relationship together.
