\-Rastik to Paul Tanasin[1]

The **Well of Sorrows** is a pool of reddish liquid contained deep within the [[Dark Keep\|Dark Keep]], in the city of [[Pitch\|Pitch]].

## Purpose & Usage
The well is the source of all Dark One's powers, and grants them knowledge of the secrets of their powers. The well is not filled by any mortal hands, and only a Dark One can then drink from the well. The well appears to call to the Dark One, enticing them to drink from it.
[[Nikka\|Nikka]]'s memory is restored simply from being near the well. She can show Paul these memories due to being surrounded by so much power here.

## Location
The well is located deep within the Dark keep, past all the [[Ironkeeper\|Ironkeeper]]'s standing guard. It is contained in a large circular room, overlooked by many towering statues, many times the size of a human.
