## Properties
Harmonium is the condensed elemental form of [[Harmony\|Harmony's]] power. Alloying [[Atium\|atium]] and [[Lerasium\|lerasium]] will not produce harmonium. While difficult, it is possible to obtain atium and lerasium from harmonium, but not through mechanical means.
Storing too much harmonium in one place supposedly can lead to the production of a perpendicularity, due to the large concentration of Investiture. Due to this, the South Scadrians make it a rule to never store too much harmonium together.

### Chemical Properties
Due to the merging of [[Ruin\|Ruin]] and [[Preservation\|Preservation's]] [[Shard\|intents]] into Harmony, harmonium's [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual aspect]] is in opposition with itself, leading to effects on the metal's [[Physical Realm\|Physical aspect]], which makes it extremely reactive. It reacts violently with water, similar to . After reacting with water, residual harmonium hydroxide is left behind, though the substance's properties are unknown. The [[Southern Scadrian\|Southern Scadrians]] use harmonium to create powerful bombs, which the [[Set\|Set]] have been trying to replicate with limited success. Harmonium corrodes and can react strongly in contact with the air; in order to prevent this, it is stored within oil. It does not react with acids.
It is soft and pliable like gold, especially when heated via flame or electricity. When heated by electricity and slowly drawn apart, a nugget of harmonium begins to separate, with the two parts beginning to take on the traits of atium and lerasium. However, when the string of metal between them is cut, both sides return to being mere harmonium.
It has an extraordinarily high melting point, above 3,000 degrees. When heated, it lets off a full spectrum of light, with an unknown color of the spectrum going off the spectrometric scale.

### Reaction to Trellium
When harmonium has electric currents moving passing through it the metal softens and can be split in half. If, during this process, [[Trellium\|trellium]] is inserted between the two pieces a violent reaction occurs as the matter of both metals are converted into pure energy. This reaction is not complete, only converting a small fraction of the used metals into energy. The blast is powerful enough that not even [[Autonomy\|Autonomy]] or [[Harmony\|Harmony]] are aware as to how strong an explosion of it can be. Minor fragments of [[Lerasium\|lerasium]] and [[Atium\|atium]] are also produced by this reaction.
Harmonium and Trellium repel each other, with the strength of repulsion becoming stronger the closer they are forced together.

## Metallic Arts
 
The [[Allomancy\|Allomantic]], [[Feruchemy\|Feruchemical]], and [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgic]] properties of harmonium are unknown. Because of its volatile nature near water, ingesting harmonium is likely to be fatal for Allomancers, though a full [[Allomancy\|Mistborn]] who is also able to heal through the explosive damage (e.g., by [[Compounding\|Compounding]] [[/wiki/Gold#Feruchemical Use]] for health) could burn it for some effect. Hemalurgic spikes would also likely be difficult to create, due to the metal's reactivity; however, it is not impossible.

### Mechanical Uses
In conjunction with Southern [[Scadrian\|Scadrian]] technology, harmonium can reproduce Allomantic or Feruchemical powers within its vicinity. The Southern Scadrians use the metal in small **primer cubes** that can somehow regulate harmonium's effects with the flip of a switch. When used Allomantically, the metal is said to burn "with a pure whiteness" and will slowly be consumed in the same way that it would be by a Misting or Mistborn. It is used to fuel Southern Scadrian Allomantic technology, including their airships that run via [[Steel\|steelpushing]]. The cubes themselves are rare, since harmonium is highly regulated.
Northern Scadrians refer to the cubes as **"Allomantic grenades"** since they are a self-contained source of Allomantic powers once they are charged. After Wax, Marasi, and other Northerners began regularly interacting with the [[Malwish\|Malwish]], they gained access to more cubes and used them to aid in their police work. The design of the cubes was also refined around this time.
It is theoretically possible to use a primer cube to reproduce other manifestations of [[Investiture\|Investiture]], such as [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]].

## Trivia
If harmonium followed the naming conventions of the other God Metals it would have been named *Sazedium*. However, [[Sazed\|Sazed]] didn't like the sound of it.
[[Brandon Sanderson\|Brandon Sanderson]] has described harmonium as "super-cesium" in reference to its violent chemical reaction with water. , like other real-life , is extremely reactive and will cause an explosion with water even at sub-zero temperatures. He later clarified that cesium was not intended as a direct analogue; harmonium would theoretically be classified as an alkali metal, although it has a different melting point.
The Mistborn Metal Dice Set from Crafty Games lists a non-canonical description of harmonium's properties, stating "Unknown in the Classic Era, Harmonium replicates the effects of nearby Allomantic or Feruchemical metals." It also lists harmonium as an Internal and Pushing God Metal.
