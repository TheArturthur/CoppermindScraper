A **Deviation** is a difference between the actual events and the recreated version inside a  caused by the presence and interference of the officers observing the events. When evidence found in Snapshots is presented at trial a Deviation Percentage is calculated and presented. Deviations can be caused by anything small or large and are impossible to completely eliminate. Cops in Snapshots are required to stay in safe houses when not investigating as to minimize Deviations but even this sometimes fails. One day Davis tried to eliminate all Deviations by locking himself in a room all day, but while slamming the door to the room he woke up a woman in the next room and caused a Deviation level of 20 percent.
Going in or out of a Snapshot can cause huge Deviations. The best way to observe a Snapshot without Deviations is to insert people at the very beginning and try not to mess it up.
