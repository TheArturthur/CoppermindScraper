**Calaka** is a resident of [[Babilar\|Babilar]].

## Appearance and Personality
He is tall and has blue hair. He does not think that the [[Reckoners\|Reckoners]] should be fighting against the [[Epic\|Epics]] and believes that standing up to them only makes things worse for everyone else.

## History
Calaka was at the [[Party in Babilar\|party in Babilar]] with [[Infinity\|Infinity]], [[Marco (Reckoners)\|Marco]], and [[Lulu\|Lulu]]. When [[Mizzy\|Mizzy]] introduced [[David\|David]] to the group, Calaka made a derogatory comment about David's drab appearance, and she punched him in the arm as retribution. Taking a glass of glowing juice, he asked David where he was from and then told Mizzy he didn't think [[Steve\|Steve]] was at the party. Infinity mentioned Steve being caught up in [[Obliteration\|Obliteration's]] explosions a few days before, so Calaka and the others raised a glass in his memory. Calaka expressed his disgust with the Reckoners' actions, and then the group moved on to discussion of [[Edso\|Edso's]] music.
