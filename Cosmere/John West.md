## Abilities and Attributes

Consumption of carbon materials, such as charcoal, can replenish nanites. Runian has a visual overlay that shows him his status.

### Early Life
In his childhood, he would often go fishing with a woman he called Grandmother Dobson, he still looks fondly upon those memories.
He joined art school, but he felt as if he could never compete with anyone else in the school, he dropped out. Following his dropping out, he tried to join the police with [[Ryan Chu\|Ryan Chu]], training as a forensic artist, but was eventually kicked out of that as well because "he didn't have the right attitude", as his teachers told him.
Washed up and with nowhere to go, he joined Fabian Augments, but ultimately was just used as a door guard after his career as a boxer who played in rigged fights to earn his boss, [[Ulric\|Ulric]], money. During his last fight, his chest and head augments were purposely turned off, and he threw the fight with [[Quinn\|Quinn]], but due to the lack of augments he was damaged far more than usual and had to quit.
At some point, Jen left for what he thought was Europe, and disappeared. Several months later he called her family to see if she was alright, and had her grandmother inform him, wrongly, that she was dead. Believing that she passed away in an accident, he spiraled further into despair.

### New Dimension
Hating his life and wanting to escape, he stole into Ulric's office and choose a random dimension to go into, but without the proper preparation, he crashed into it and lost most of his memory. Here he was found by the natives of the dimension, and mistaken for an [[Aelv\|aelv]]; and in this misunderstanding, he was knocked out and taken captive.
After saving the country from Ulric and the [[Hordamen\|Hordamen]], and after learning how he could prevent his presence from harming the entities around him, he decided to continue living in the dimension, and eventually married [[Sefawynn\|Sefawynn]].
