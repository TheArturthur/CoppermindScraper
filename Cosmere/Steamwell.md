**Steamwells** are naturally occurring geysers that serve as the primary water supply to the villages in [[Torio\|Torio]] on [[Komashi\|Komashi]].
Steamwells provide water to the people and animals who live nearby. The jet of water when steamwells erupt can reach several dozen feet into the air, though the height can vary somewhat from one region to the next. In villages, large elevated bronze trays are arrayed around the steamwell in concentric rings, funneling the water from eruptions down toward the nearby homes. The water is considered by the people to be a gift from the [[Hijo\|hijo]] below ground. Rural villages are typically centered around a local steamwell, making it the focal point of the settlement.
Steamwells also increase the local humidity, nourishing plants in the area. Clouds often form above steamwells, providing shade and rainfall. The geysers are believed to renew the air with each eruption.
