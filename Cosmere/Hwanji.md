## History
Hwanji is from a village in Torio. At some point in time, scholars from the university in [[Torio City\|Torio City]] came to her village and helped with crop diseases. She eventually became an attendant to yoki-hijo [[Dwookim\|Dwookim]], who was very local in the [[Reform movement\|reform movement]]. After Dwookim's retirement, Hwanji became an attendant of Yumi, under [[Liyun\|Liyun]]. Her duties included feeding, bathing, and dressing Yumi, as well as escorting her, fetching needs such as water, and performing various other acts of service. Following the activation of the [[Machine\|machine]], Hwanji was turned into a [[Nightmare\|nightmare]].
Hwanji continued to attend Yumi over the centuries that followed, at the direction of the machine, until the time of Yumi and [[Nikaro\|Nikaro's]] bond. When Nikaro, in Yumi's body, began painting during the time of ritual prayer, Hwanji was the first subject he used. Hwanji became fearful that Liyun would assume she was responsible for encouraging Yumi's rebellious actions. She confronted Yumi about this concern, and reluctantly but respectfully explained the reform movement after realizing the yoki-hijo was entirely unaware of the movement. When Nikaro and Yumi decided to confront the scholars, Hwanji excitedly grabbed Nikaro's arm and expressed a distrust of the scholars currently in the village. Hwanji was the final nightmare that Nikaro painted during the [[Battle of Kilahito\|battle of Kilahito]].
