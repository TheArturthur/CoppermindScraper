## Appearance and Personality
 by  Sheep 
Palona is described as having [[Darkeyed\|dark eyes]] and the typical rocklike crystalline fingernails of a Herdazian. She is short, middle-aged, and has dark, curly hair. She speaks with a Herdazian accent and presumably has the typical deep tan skin of her people.
She is kind, although she is sometimes blunt. She can be thoughtful and considerate towards people she cares about.
Palona enjoys luxury, spending money, and wearing fashionable clothing, yet she is not pretentious. She sometimes appears to be detached from events occurring around her, as she is seen relaxing with a novel during the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]] and reading gossip reports amidst the squabbling of Rosharan royalty. Her contemporaries, including [[Shallan\|Shallan]] and [[Navani Kholin\|Navani Kholin]], tend to make light of her penchant for massages.
Although she is not married to Turinad, she runs the household and appears to be familiar with the traditions of Alethi nobility. However, she does not have the modesty of a typical [[Vorin\|Vorin]] woman, as she does not cover her back while being massaged, even when other people are present. She covers her [[Safehand\|safehand]], but is sometimes careless about showing it.

## History
Little is known of Palona's history before meeting Sebarial. Her age and birthplace are unknown. Towards the end of the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]], there had been significant migration of Herdazian people to [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] and [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]] and the Sebarial warcamp likely had the largest Herdazian population on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]], but neither of those facts have been explicitly linked to Palona's life among the Alethi. The duration of Palona and Sebarial's relationship was also unclear, but he apparently took her in at some point. Their relationship seemed to be well-established by the end of the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]]; other nobles were never surprised by Palona's presence, nor did they comment on the nature of her arrangement with Sebarial.

### Shattered Plains
 by  Marie Seeberger  During the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]]
Palona was first seen living in the Sebarial warcamp on the Shattered Plains. The Sebarial warcamp was well-constructed and more similar to a city than other warcamps, and Palona lived in a manor with Turinad. Their home's interior was particularly opulent, with marble, silk, crystal, and gold among the materials used in the decor. The residence also had numerous servants, running water, and gardens with ornamental [[Shalebark\|shalebark]].
When Sebarial brought Shallan to the manor, Palona was very welcoming. She ensured that Shallan received a stipend that Turinad promised, her own room and servants, housing for her entourage, and the use of a horse-drawn carriage for transportation. She also helped Shallan improve the Herdazian accent that she occasionally used while disguised. Palona reviewed reports from Shallan regarding both House Sebarial's finances and updates on local events.
As the mistress of a Highprince, Palona attended many events for the [[Alethi\|Alethi]] elite. She was present when [[Adolin\|Adolin]] and [[Renarin Kholin\|Renarin Kholin]] fought an ill-advised duel against multiple Shardbearers. She insisted on coming to the Shattered Plains when Sebarial agreed to join [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin's]] assault on the [[Parshendi\|Parshendi]]. Palona wore fashionable clothing while she and Sebarial lounged and ate [[Sellafruit\|sellafruit]], even as the fighting escalated. Dalinar was surprised to learn that Sebarial actually helped during the battle, indicating that the couple may have been paying more attention than it seemed.

### Urithiru
Palona was among the many residents of the Shattered Plains who moved to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] after the activation of the [[Stormseat\|Stormseat]] [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]]. Sebarial's actions at the end of the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]] gained Dalinar's trust and he was named [[Highprince of Commerce\|Highprince of Commerce]], giving House Sebarial additional influence in the displaced Alethi government. Palona was among the first people to see the corpse of [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas]] after his murder in the halls of Urithiru, and flippantly called his death a "problem solved", as she was one of the many people who hated Sadeas. She was present at Dalinar and Navani's small wedding ceremony, as well as Dalinar's meetings when he attempted to form a multinational coalition as part of his plan to unite Roshar. She was one of the first people to know that [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]] had been crowned as Queen.
Palona and Sebarial were living in the tower shortly before its occupation by the [[Fused\|Fused]]. Navani noticed that Sebarial had started dressing better, and wondered if Palona was behind the change. Navani planned to send Sebarial back to the warcamps to fill the power void left by [[Ialai\|Ialai's]] death and bring order back to the area. Palona likely accompanied Sebarial on this task; they were not seen during the occupation.

## Relationships
 by  Elisgardor  Palona and [[Sebarial\|Sebarial]]
### Turinad Sebarial
Palona and Turinad have an unusual relationship. In general, the two of them get along well, and tend to playfully antagonize one another. Palona claims that Turinad wants to marry her, while Turinad has joked that he pays more than three [[Broam\|broams]] a week for Palona. However, there also seem to be some barriers between them. Although Palona seems confident in many situations, she has also obliquely referred to herself as a "stray" that Turinad brought home. Turinad reveals to Navani that he truly does want to marry Palona, but she has continually rebuffed him for reasons that remain unclear. He believes that she either considers him unworthy of her or vice versa, but she tends to evade his questions. Navani believes that Turinad's generally frivolous attitude in life might be causing Palona to feel undervalued, and advises him to be more sincere with her.

### Shallan Davar
Palona was particularly welcoming to Shallan when she came to live at the Sebarial warcamp. Palona helpfully anticipated Shallan's needs, and often paid personal visits to her quarters. Shallan is very grateful to Palona for taking her in, and after the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]], she continues to live in the Sebarial section of Urithiru. Shallan sees Palona as something of a mother figure who often checks in on her. Palona appears in [[Shallan's sketchbook\|Shallan's sketchbook]], and her face sometimes appears in Shallan's Lightweaving illusions. Palona took an interest in Shallan's interaction with [[Re-Shephir\|Re-Shephir]], and thought that the other [[Unmade\|Unmade]] should be sought out to ensure that they were imprisoned.
