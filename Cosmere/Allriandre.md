**Allriandre Durkel** is a single mother in [[Elendel\|Elendel]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. [[Durkel\|Her father]] was killed by [[Wayne\|Wayne]] before he became a lawman. Years later, she inherited Wayne's wealth following his death, allowing her to provide for [[Ruri\|her daughter]].

## History
She was presumably born in the [[Roughs\|Roughs]]; her father was a bookkeeper in [[Far Dorest\|Far Dorest]]. Her father was a good man who regularly performed charity work, but Wayne accidentally killed him during an attempted mugging when he was sixteen years old. Wayne learned about the man's family, including Allriandre and her two siblings, during his trial. He began giving her family half of his earnings as a means of atonement. The children sometimes wrote him angry letters to let him know that he was not forgiven.
Allriandre attended [[Elendel University\|Elendel University]] and lived in Pashadon Hall, a girls' dormitory. She was considering going into law. Wayne visited Allriandre on the first of each month to bring her a stipend, at her mother's request. Allriandre carried an evanotype picture of her father in a locket and forced Wayne to look at it and acknowledge that he killed him. She always looked at Wayne with a frosty emotionless expression. She despised that Wayne insisted on delivering the stipend personally.
After graduating from university, Allriandre attempted to open an art studio. However, the business failed, and she became overwhelmed with a debt of at least 10,000 [[Boxing\|boxings]]. She had to raise her daughter [[Ruri\|Ruri]] on her own, without the girl’s father or any of Allriandre’s friends from university. She worked in a forge in Elendel, sorting pieces of metal. Despite her negative feelings towards Wayne, she relied on the payments each month to pay the rent on her apartment. Her responsibilities left her little time to read broadsheets; due to this she remained largely ignorant of the events surrounding the evacuation prior to the [[Set\|Set's]] attempt to destroy Elendel
Following Wayne’s death, Allriandre returns to her apartment to [[Coussaint\|her landlord]] scolding Ruri for painting the walls with toothpaste. She calms her daughter before [[Call\|two]] [[Garisel Daring\|men]] arrive. The men are Wayne's accountants, who inform her that Wayne died stopping the Set's [[Harmonium\|harmonium]]-[[Trellium\|trellium]] bomb from destroying Elendel. She had mixed feelings regarding the news of the death of the man who killed her father; upon reflection she decided that she was sorry that Wayne had died. She discovers from the accountants that she inherited Wayne’s wealth following his death, totalling approximately 120 million boxings. While previously in debt, Wayne’s assets make her around the fourth richest person in Elendel, and she optimistically plans to bring the rest of her family from the [[Roughs\|Roughs]] to the city. The two also give Allriandre a note written to her from Wayne; the note simply reads "Sorry".

## Trivia
Wayne's scene with Allriandre is purposefully awkward and is intended to demonstrate Wayne's deep-seated emotional need to prove that is he a good person.
She may be named after [[Allrianne Cett\|Allrianne Cett]] and/or [[Beldre\|Beldre]], as the [[Originators\|Originators]] had achieved legendary status by the time of her birth hundreds of years after the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]].
