The **Roughs** are the frontier regions just outside the [[Elendel Basin\|Elendel Basin]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. They are separated from the fertile basin by mountain ranges, and are divided into the **Northern Roughs** and the **Southern Roughs** (with the [[Irongate River\|Irongate River]] as the approximate dividing line).
The ideal conditions in the Basin meant that there was little pressure to expand following the founding of [[Elendel\|Elendel]]. As a result of this, the Roughs were sparsely populated and less advanced than the urban centers even generations later.
Giraffes inhabit the northern roughs, and acacia trees grow there. A political movement once began to make the Roughs a province within the Elendel Basin with political representation. Others within the Roughs instead favored the idea of being their own nation.
