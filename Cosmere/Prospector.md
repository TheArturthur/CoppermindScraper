## Design and Use
Like most ships on Canticle, prospectors are shaped like old naval boats with a bulbous cab at the back containing a two person cockpit and a few small rooms, flat round undersides housing the prospecting gear, and a wide deck at the front ringed by a railing. They are presumably able to lock in with other ships to create larger structures. Prospectors typically work in teams to methodically canvas an area for sunhearts, their prospecting gear working like a metal detector but for detecting investiture. The ships have a function similar to a [[Seeker\|Seeker]], but are noted to be surprisingly large for such a simple function. Prospectors are not particularly dynamic ships though they are more maneuverable than larger transports. The prospectors are also used by both the [[Cinder King\|Cinder King]] and the people of [[Beacon\|Beacon]] to locate the [[Scadrian\|Scadrian]] [[Scadrian research facility\|research facility]]

### Instrumentation
Prospectors have separate controls for movement and operating the prospecting gear. The prospecting controls produce an audible ping when they detect Investiture. The ships are equipped with sensors for both internal and external temperature, radar, and a communication system that functions similarly to radio.
