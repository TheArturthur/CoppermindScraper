**Kingsport** is a city presumably in the [[Emerald Sea\|Emerald Sea]] on [[Lumar\|Lumar]]; it is also presumably the residence of the [[Verdant King\|Verdant King]], and as such is located on the [[Core Archipelago\|Core Archipelago]]. Reports about possible [[Deadrunner\|deadrunners]] are sent to the port, which is located far from [[Shimmerbay\|Shimmerbay]].
[[Charlie\|Charlie]] claimed that there was constant war at the port, to the extent that gardeners must be trained in the art of warfare; however, it is likely that this was merely another of his stories. After Charlie's disappearance, [[Tress\|Tress]] planned to go to Kingsport to plead that the king pay Charlie's ransom. When she had the opportunity to do so, however, she instead remained with the crew of the *Crow's Song*.
[[Crow\|Crow]] had news via a raven from a contact in Kingsport that the remnants of the *Oot's Dream* had been found, but that there were no survivors, just the corpse of the one man that Crow had left alive.
