The **garqua** is a water-dwelling creature that comes from [[Monrome\|Monrome]]. They look similar to snakes, and are as thick as a manâ€™s thigh. They have little flippered legs and a very long body, which they sometimes keep partially coiled. They are blue, with serpentine heads. They are very strong swimmers, capable of towing a raft with two full sized humans on it. They are not dangerous, and like to eat fruit. Though they come from Monrome, the [[Dione\|diones]] have colonized nearly a hundred planets and import their wildlife, such as the garqua, to those other planets after exterminating the local species for being too aggressive.
