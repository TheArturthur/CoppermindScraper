\-Contemplation speaking of Refuge[1]

The **Refuge** or the **Refuge of Stone** is an apocryphal underground city on [[Canticle\|Canticle]] believed to have been created by the  long ago. The Sunlit Ones were said to have been able to take in the sunlight and use it rather than being destroyed and were therefore able to stay in one place long enough to build the city beneath the ground using stones that Canticle's sun cannot melt. As the people on Canticle always need to be moving forward to outpace the sun, Refuge represents a sanctuary from their eternal migration.
