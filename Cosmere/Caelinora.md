**Caelinora** is an [[Honorspren\|honorspren]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. She is bonded to [[Huio\|Huio]].

## Attributes and Abilities
As an honorspren, Caelinora presumably has the inherent abilities of her species, including flight and shapeshifting. She can initiate a [[Nahel bond\|Nahel bond]], which allows her to transition to the [[Physical Realm\|Physical Realm]] and makes her bonded partner a [[Order of Windrunners\|Windrunner]].

## History
Caelinora likely bonded Huio after the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]], as Huio had only recently become a Radiant squire at that point.
Huio and Caelinora were selected to join the [[Expedition to Akinah\|expedition to Akinah]] in late 1174. By that time, Huio had sworn the first two Ideals of the Windrunners. Although Caelinora rarely appeared to [[Lopen\|Lopen]], she was visible to [[Cord\|Cord]] since she was one of the [[Sighted\|Sighted]].
Huio swore the Third Ideal during the [[Sleepless\|hordeling]] battle on the shores of Akinah, advancing his bond with Caelinora; this surprised Lopen, who was happy for the pair but a bit envious at first. Huio wielded Caelinora as a massive living [[Shardblade\|Shardhammer]] that could instantly transform into a Shardspear at his command.
