The **Silverlight Codes of Interplanetary Conduct** are a set of codes governing interplanetary conduct which were supposedly written and enforced by [[Silverlight\|Silverlight]].

## Bills
The Codes are a collection of bills, only one of which is currently known. **The Refugee and Lost Expatriate Bill** allows individuals to request asylum in interplanetary facilities, and likely from other entities as well, and seems to force such entities into giving asylum under unspecified circumstances.
