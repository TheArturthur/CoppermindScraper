**Duralumin** is the internal enhancement pushing metal. An Allomancer burning duralumin is able to greatly enhance other metals they are burning by releasing all of the power of the metals at once instead of over time. Feruchemists can use duralumin to store [[Connection\|Connection]], and when used as a Hemalurgic spike, duralumin steals Connection and [[Identity\|Identity]].
Duralumin is the alloy paired with [[Aluminum\|aluminum]] in the Metallic Arts.

## Alloy Composition
The duralumin used in the Metallic Arts is ninety-six percent aluminum, four percent [[Copper\|copper]].

## Allomantic Use
A duralumin [[Misting\|Misting]] is known as a **Duralumin Gnat**. An Allomancer burning duralumin instantly uses up any metals being burned simultaneously, releasing an enormous burst of power from those metals. Due to this, the more metal they have on them upon burning duralumin, the greater the burst of power. Duralumin itself is not completely consumed like metals it is burned in concert with, but it still continues to burn away at a steady rate. A Duralumin Gnat gains nothing from their powers.
The use of duralumin could seriously hurt a [[/wiki/Allomancy#Types of Allomancers]]. While burning [[Tin\|tin]], the Mistborn risks being shocked by the sensory overload and becoming temporarily numb, blind, and deaf. A [[Steel\|Push]] or [[Iron\|Pull]] could become so strong it can feel like the Mistborn is being torn apart. When using duralumin, Mistborn usually burn pewter along with tin/iron/steel to avoid injuries.
When combined with emotional Allomancy, duralumin allows Allomancers to "break into" and gain control of Hemalurgic constructs such as kandra and koloss, even if they would not normally have enough raw power to do so.
Duralumin could potentially be used to gain a burst of power from other forms of [[Investiture\|Investiture]] as well, such as [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]]. Burning duralumin while also [[Compounding\|Compounding]] any other metal does not gain anything other than time, and is quite dangerous due to the swift effects of the duralumin.

## Feruchemical Use
A duralumin [[Ferring\|Ferring]] is known as a **Connector**. Duralumin is used to store Spiritual [[Connection\|Connection]]. Filling a duraluminmind can be used to reduce other people's awareness of and friendship with the Connector, as these Spiritual Connections become stored away. Tapping it would strengthen Connections or allow the Connector to form relationships faster.
[[Southern Scadrian\|Southern Scadrians]] use [[Unsealed metalminds\|unsealed]] duraluminminds to enable them to communicate with others on foreign lands. They still retain their native accent when doing so, though someone could develop a local accent by blanking their [[Identity\|Identity]]. This ability can be used on other planets, though it does not grant the ability to travel between worlds. Tapping a duraluminmind would also allow someone to overcome the location restriction on [[Sel\|Selish]] Invested Arts; for example, an [[Elantrian\|Elantrian]] could use [[Aon\|Aons]] at full power regardless of location, though there are also easier ways to achieve this. It could also allow a person to become a squire to multiple Orders of [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]], though there are, again, easier ways.
A duraluminmind would be able to interpret [[Rhythm\|rhythms]], albeit not very accurately.

### Compounding
A duralumin [[Compounding\|Compounder]] would be able to use duralumin to have a nearly infinite supply of Spiritual Connection. The Compounder would be able to put a [[Hemalurgic\|Hemalurgic]] creature under complete control, similar to what [[Brass\|Soothers]] and [[Zinc\|Rioters]] can do.

## Hemalurgic Use
When used as a Hemalurgic spike, duralumin steals [[Connection\|Connection]] and [[Identity\|Identity]].

## History
During the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]], the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]] kept [[Aluminum\|aluminum]] and its alloy duralumin from public knowledge to give the [[Inquisitors\|Inquisitors]] an advantage. Aluminum and duralumin were also unknown to people due to the advanced technology (electrolysis) required to refine it. Without that technology, the Lord Ruler acquired small amounts of aluminum from ashmounts.
[[Vin\|Vin]], after being fed aluminum by the Inquisitors, figured there should be an alloy for it, too. Despite the risk to herself, she tested out various alloys of aluminum with [[Terion\|Terion's]] help, and eventually discovered an alloy that didn't cause sickness when burned -- duralumin. However, since she wasn't burning any other metal at the same time, the duralumin seemed to generate no effect. Later, while sparring with [[Zane\|Zane]], Vin was stunned to find out the effect of duralumin.
She carefully kept the secret of duralumin and used it to great advantage on several occasions later in combination with both physical and mental Allomancy. [[TenSoon\|TenSoon]] and Zane eventually found out about duralumin, however, allowing Zane to use it against her.
Duralumin became Allomantically useless in practice over the centuries after the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]] due to the fading away of Mistborn, though the Southern Scadrians made Feruchemical use of it in their unsealed metalminds. Duralumin's great power has essentially faded into myth. It is primarily associated with the Ascendent Warrior, and only recognized as a thing of scripture.
However, knowledge of it was not lost even in the North; it eventually became commonplace with the development of the right metallurgical processes, and once the [[Set\|Set]] began working with Hemalurgy, it became relevant again to specific people. The Set gave [[Dumad\|Dumad]] a spike for duralumin Allomancy, which he used effectively in combination with Steelpushing.
After Dumad's death, [[Wax\|Wax]] used the spike on himself and used his newly duralumin-enhanced Steelpushing to reach the [[Pewternaut\|Pewternaut]] A16. [[Wayne\|Wayne]] then became Mistborn by burning [[Lerasium\|lerasium]] and used duralumin with [[Bendalloy\|bendalloy]] in order to prematurely detonate the bomb on board the ship, which required precise timing that would have been impossible to achieve otherwise.

## Trivia
 is a real alloy of aluminum, and is fairly common.
If Vin hadn't had duralumin in the fight at the [[Luthadel Assembly\|Luthadel Assembly]] meeting, both she and [[Elend\|Elend]] would have died.
An alternative ending to *[[The Well of Ascension\|The Well of Ascension]]* has a conversation about duralumin between Vin and [[Elend\|Elend]].
Brandon had [[Elend\|Elend]] burn both duralumin and [[Atium\|atium]] at the [[Battle of Hathsin\|Battle of Hathsin]] because a lot of people had asked about the combination.
