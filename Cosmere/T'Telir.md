## Geography
  Map of T'Telir from a tapestry hanging in the palace of <<Lightsong\|Lightsong>> the Bold, circa 327, not to scale
The city of T'Telir is located somewhere in Hallandren, close to Idris. T'Telir lies in a tropical climate; the temperature is quite warm and colorful animals and flowers are common. Harsh weather is rare in T'Telir.. The growth of plants in the region around T'Telir is helped by [[Investiture\|Investiture]], much like the [[Elendel Basin\|Elendel Basin]]. This access to Investiture, as well as the local climate, is the reason that the jungle around T'Telir is the only place in which the [[Tears of Edgli\|Tears of Edgli]] grow.
T'Telir is located on the shores of the [[Bright Sea\|Bright Sea]]. The city is built in a crescent around a bay of the [[Bright Sea\|Bright Sea]], abutting the water. The city's placement in this bay, protecting it from storms, makes it a prime port.
The area in the direct vicinity of T'Telir is characterized by stands of palm trees and sandy soil. Beyond that stretch, the landscape gives way to a jungle.

## Landmarks
### The City Walls
T'Telir has a large city wall, commonly described as Immense and even daunting, while almost looking more artistic then functional. The wall's top is curved in massive half-circles, like rolling hills, and the rim is plated with a golden metal. The gates themselves are described as in the form of two twisting, lithe sea creatures who curve up in a massive archway. The position of the city on the sea means that the city wall only has to run around the landward half-circle of the city.

>“*Many of the painted buildings did clash, but none of it was sloppy. There was a sense of craftsmanship and art to everything from the storefronts, to the people, to the statues of mighty soldiers that frequently stood on corners.*”
\-Siri describing T'Telir

### The Court of Gods
T'Telir contains the [[Court of Gods\|Court of Gods]]. The Court is built on a plateau in the south of the city, and is entirely walled off. The Court consists of a number of palaces for the [[Returned\|Returned]], a large palace for the [[God King\|God King]], and an Arena used for entertainment. The Court exists to protect the [[Returned\|Returned]], so that they may bless humanity, and to rule [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]].
T'Telir also contains the [[Lifeless\|lifeless]] enclave, a compound-like building containing the entire Halllandren army; roughly forty thousand lifeless. This makes T'Telir the starting point of any invasion.

### D'Denir Celabrin
Another notable feature of T'Telir lies in the [[D'Denir\|D'Denir]] Celabrin, imposing statues of warriors supposedly left as a memorial to those who died in the [[Manywar\|Manywar]] and as a reminder to the [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]] of the cost of war. The people of  often put colorful clothing on the statues for fun. Some statues, particularly those located in the [[Idris\|Idrian]] slums, have been defaced or broken. The first ones were left to the city by [[Peacegiver\|Peacegiver the Blessed]] right after the Manywar, though new ones are commissioned yearly by the Returned.
Most of the original statues reside in the D'Denir Garden, an open grassy field with many statues; this garden is one of the only ones in the city which doesn't feature flowers and trees and isn't full of bustling people. The exact location is unknown, but it is somewhere in the north of the city. The garden is noticeably quiet and serene in comparison to the rest of T'Telir. Despite this, it is a popular place for clandestine meetings after hours.

### Docks
T'Telir lies on the shores of the [[Bright Sea\|Bright Sea]], and because of its location in a sheltered bay, T'Telir is a prime port. The T'Telirite docks are made up of the shipyards, a number of warehouses and the dock slums. These slums are located between the shipyards and the warehouses. The dockslums are full of dockhands, who live and drink here.
T'Telir has a number of [[Stormrunners\|Stormrunners]]. Everyone who wants to fish in T'Telir waters needs to pay a fee. Some people avoid this by fishing at night however. There are people at the docks who sew nets. The slumlords of T'Telir often dump bodies in the bay, hiring people to go out at night and sink the bodies.

### Markets
T'Telir has many markets. Like the rest of T'Telir, the markets are very colorful. Most of the markets in T'Telir are decorated with the D'Denir Celabrin. When entering the markets a person is instantly bombarded by the sight, sound, scent, and colors of T'Telir.
The wealthier shopping districts do not contain merchants raising tents to shade themselves as they sell wares. Instead, there are many high quality, colorful shops with more expensive goods. While performers are present in these markets, there are fewer than in the average shopping district. The T'Telirite markets are full of merchants from distant kingdoms, such as [[Idris\|Idris]], [[Tedradel\|Tedradel]], and likely the kingdoms beyond the mountains.

### Color
T’Telir, like the rest of Hallandren, is extremely colorful. Buildings are painted in a wide array of, often very bright, colors. The same goes for the people, most of whom wear brightly colored clothing and even dye their hair. Even furniture and other objects are painted. Due to this there are very few dull things in the city, and most of them are located in the slums, which contain objects and buildings with faded colors. The T'Telirites love greenery and as such the city is designed with many gardens and open spaces that show off its greenery and have palm trees and other flora growing along the streets.

### Wealthy Areas
The wealthy areas of the city are very diverse, ranging from huge mansions to regular sized houses. These residential areas tend to have less people walking around. Since Hallandren has no nobility these houses are likely owned by merchants. The flora in these districts is described as being incredibly diverse. Dozens of different species of palms, ferns, grasses, and potted flowers, including the [[Tears of Edgli\|Tears of Edgli]], can be found in the gardens of the houses and on the streets. Like in most of the city there are many [[D'Denir\|D'Denir]] statues located in these districts.
Almost none of the roads in the city are made of anything other then dirt, although most roads have slate sidewalks for people to walk upon, and the streets are lined with lanterns. The people tend to stay on the sidewalks because carriages are common. The wealthier shopping districts do not contain merchants raising tents to shade themselves as they sell wares. Instead, there are many high quality, colorful shops with more expensive goods. While performers are present in these commercial areas, there are fewer than in the average shopping district.

### Slums
T'Telir is home to many slums. While there are different varieties of slums, they generally have a couple characteristics. Like the rest of T'Telir most of the slums are colorful, even though the colors are a little faded. The slums also contain parks like the rest of the city, although these are very dirty, like the slums themselves. The D’Denir statues that decorate much of T'Telir are in various states of disrepair in the slums. There are soup kitchens which provide very cheap meals, with food being available for only two bits.
The best known slum in T'Telir is the Highlands, the [[Idris\|Idrian]] quarter in the city. The Highlands are located in the north of the city, and most Idrians live here. The Highlands are less colorful then the rest of T’Telir, although there are still many colors. This slum is ruled by three slumlords, [[Paxen\|Paxen]], [[Ashu\|Ashu]] and [[Rira (character)\|Rira]]. Furthermore there are many brothels, most only a short distance away from the edge of the Highlands. [[Vivenna\|Vivenna]] describes the place as unwelcome.

## Culture
### People
There are many different peoples and cultures in T’Telir. The most prevalent people are the Hallandren. Other prevalent cultures in T’Telir include Pahn Kahl and Idrian.
T’Telir has no nobility, instead it has a small but very rich class which is almost completely compromised of the most successful merchants, a middle class, and a large peasant class. Hallandren is the only nation on [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]] to have such a large middle class. Due to this large middle class T’Telir has many features that the rest of the world lacks.
One of these features is restaurants. Restaurants are only possible because of the middle class, which is large, and rich, enough to support businesses. T’Telirites often eat lunch at restaurants, as during midday it makes more sense to buy food rather then return all the way home. It is a common practice to wipe your fingers on the tablecloth. Lots of enterprising young street boys wander the neighborhoods proclaiming their services, willing to deliver food from restaurants right to people's homes for a fee. The people in T'Telir like spicy food, and their food is often centered around seafood, and seasoned with exotic spices.

>“*People jostled their way through the streets, draped ﬂagrantly in colors, yelling, and talking, and moving, and stinking, and coughing, and bumping.*”
\-Vivenna's first impression of T'Telir[12]

The people in the slums are often dirty and beaten down. Most slums are ruled by people called slumlords, the crime lords of specific slums in the city. The poor in T'Telir take any jobs they can, including prostitution for women and work in the dye fields for men. A lot of people here also beg for money, although this profession isn’t very rewarding in T'Telir. There are also underground fighting matches where men can see people, often Idrians, box eachother to unconsciousness, these matches are often funded by slumlords.
The T’Telirites enjoy music, painting, dance, poetry, sculpture, puppetry, play performance, sandpainting and lots of other ‘lesser’ arts. Weapons are uncommon enough in the city that a sword draws attention. Timepieces are not common in T’Telir, and punctuality is not a high priority in the city, especially among the Returned. The T’Telirites are fond of carriages, and use them a lot in the city, although the Returned and their Queen prefer to use palanquins. T’Telirites like to be together, tending to crowd the same streets.
The T’Telirites herd livestock such as sheep and cows. they also enjoy many sorts of sealife, such as mussels, fish, and octopi, and many foreign foods. The T’Telirites keep their dead in charnel houses.

### Religion
While T’Telir is home to many different cultures, and many different religions, the largest part of the population follows the Iridescent Tones. There are also a number of [[Idris\|Idrians]] who follow [[Austrism\|Austrism]]. As there are many [[Pahn Kahl\|Pahn Kahl]] living in the city. the Pahn Kahl religion is likely practiced as well.
T’Telir contains the [[Court of Gods\|Court of Gods]], a large walled off plateau.This plateau is the home of the [[Returned\|Returned]], including the [[God King\|God King]]. Anyone in the empire who wishes to get a blessing has to send their offerings all the way to T’Telir. If people want to petition to the gods they also need to travel all the way to T’Telir. Both of these things make T’Telir very important to the religion.
T’Telir embodies everything that modern [[Austrism\|Austrism]] preaches against. For example, Austrism preaches that ostentation is forbidden while in T’Telir everyone and everything competes for attention. Another example is that Austrism considers [[Breath\|breath]] to be a part of the soul, while the T’Telirites trade in breath. This is likely on purpose as Austrism changed significantly after the Manywar, hating everything Hallandren.
During the first three hundred years of the city’s existence the majority of the population followed [[Austrism\|Austrism]], although back then it was very different from modern day [[Austrism\|Austrism]]. During this time the [[Cult of Returned\|Cult of Returned]] likely settled in Hanald, although it wasn’t very large yet. After the [[Manywar\|Manywar]] however the Hallandren people felt that Austre had forsaken them, and left them to Kalad the Usurper. Partly because of this and partly because of Peacegiver stopping the war they started to worship the [[Returned\|Returned]]. During this time the Cult of Returned grew and evolved into the Iridescent Tones. At the time of the Pahn Kahl rebellion, people are beginning to doubt their gods more and more, seeing them as less divine, weaker, and less wise.

### Politics and Laws
>“*This isn’t about money. It’s about fear. People in the court talk about what **might** happen if the Idrians cut off the passes or what **may** happen if the Idrians let enemies slip through and besiege T’Telir.*”
\-Bebid to Vasher[23]


T'Telir is the capital of Hallandren and contains the [[Court of Gods\|Court of Gods]], the home of the Returned. T’Telir, as a part of Hallandren, is ruled by the [[God King\|God King]]. The King has absolute authority and can undo any decision made by the Court of Gods, although in reality he has very little political power and is more of a figurehead. The actual decisions in T'Telir are made by the [[Returned\|Returned]], and by an extension, the priesthood.
Most of the land in and around T’Telir is private property, rather then government owned. There are also specific laws about where begging is allowed and where it isn’t, these rules aren’t taught to beggars though. Getting into a brawl in the city will get you locked up for a night, although hitting a priest of the Iridescent Tones means a death sentence. Anyone who wants to fish in the waters of T’Telir has to pay a fee.

### City Guard
T’Telir has a human garrison, although it isn’t terribly large. The city guard also contains many [[Lifeless\|lifeless]], usually directed by living humans. It is likely that the city guard also contains many of the support staff that goes along with lifeless soldiers. The city guard has a number of cavalrymen. T’Telir’s living city guard is dressed in bright yellow and blue, while the lifeless guards are dressed in purple and gold,
T’Telir is also the location of the entire [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]] [[Lifeless\|lifeless]] army. This army numbers forty thousand lifeless, fully equipped and ready to respond to any potential invasion. While this army is completely separate of the city guard, it can be called upon to defend the walls. The lifeless soldiers are described as wearing gold and blue, this might be the same as the living human guards, who’s uniforms are described as bright yellow and blue.

## History
 
### Settling and Expansion
The [[Pahn Kahl\|Pahn Kahl]] were the original inhabitants of the Hallandren lowlands, and of the bay where T'Telir was later built. They lived in scattered fishing villages in the valley's jungles. At some point, the people of [[Chedesh\|Chedesh]] discovered the lowlands and multiple ships were sent to investigate. On one of these ships, in the bay of T’Telir, a man named [[Vo\|Vo]] died, and later [[Returned\|Returned]]. After Vo died again his crewmates decided to found a kingdom, crowning his wife as Queen of [[Hanald\|Hanald]]. The place where they set foot on land would later become T’Telir.
The [[/wiki/Court of Gods#God king.E2.80.99s palace]] palace was the first building constructed in the city of T'Telir. It served as an outpost overlooking the bay and was built by the crew mates of [[Vo\|Vo]], the first Returned, three hundred years before the events of the Manywar. It would later become the residence of the Royal family of [[Hanald\|Hanald]], making T’Telir the capital.
As [[Hanald\|Hanald]] expanded and its economy grew T’Telir grew as well, both in population and in wealth. The increase in wealth happened because of a number of reasons. T’Telir is located in a bay, protecting it from storms and making it a prime port. Another reason for T’Telir’s wealth was, and still is, the farming of many products native to the Hallandren lowlands, this includes the [[Tears of Edgli\|Tears of Edgli]] which only grow in Hallandren due to the present investiture from [[Endowment\|Endowments]] [[Perpendicularity\|perpendicularity]]. This monopoly on the dye trade was a major factor for the [[Manywar\|Manywar]], as other kingdoms wished to take control.

### The Manywar
For more information, see [[Manywar\|Manywar]].
T’Telir was home to the Royal family of Hanald, the descendants of Vo. After a [[Returned\|Returned]] had a vision of war Kalad raised up a large army, and together with the Royal family’s own [[Lifeless\|lifeless]] and awakeners he seized control of [[Hanald\|Hanald]], ending three hundred years of reign. At least some of the Royal family were kept alive though, and they were stuck in T’Telir. Near the climax of the [[Manywar\|Manywar]] the remaining members of the Royal family fled T’Telir and headed north, establishing the kingdom of Idris.
After the end of the [[Manywar\|Manywar]] [[Kalad\|Kalad]], then known as [[Peacegiver\|Peacegiver]] commanded his [[Kalad's Phantoms\|Phantoms]] to enter T’Telir, and stay put like statues, calling it a gift for the city. Eventually the people of T’Telir forgot that they were [[Lifeless\|lifeless]]. Modern day Hallandren lore holds that Peacegiver "commissioned" a large number of these statues known as the D'Denir Celabrin, ostensibly as memorials and reminders not to go to war. The [[Returned\|Returned]] continue to build more statues each year throughout the city to honor Peacegiver's tradition, although these are not Phantoms.

### The Plague
>“*You mean to tell me that our God King—the most holy and divine personage in our pantheon—died to cure a few tummy aches?*”
\-Lightsong[38]


Two hundred and fifty years later, a plague of distrentia struck T'Telir. The disease was especially deadly among the elderly and the young, and the nature of it meant that it spread other diseases as well. This caused the city's commerce to slow drastically, meaning that outlying villages went months without necessary supplies. In the end, Susebron the Fourth gave his Breath to cure the plague and [[Susebron\|Susebron]] the Fifth began his rule.

### The Pahn Kahl Rebellion
For more information, see [[Pahn Kahl rebellion\|Pahn Kahl rebellion]].
Roughly thirty years into Susebron the Fifth's reign, the Hallandren priesthood signed a treaty with King [[Dedelin\|Dedelin]] of [[Idris\|Idris]]. This treaty promised peace between the nations in exchange for a marriage between Dedelin's daughter and the God King himself. At the time when the treaty was fulfilled twenty years later, T'Telir was the site of the Pahn Kahl rebellion. First, a Pahn Kahl named [[Vahr\|Vahr]], a worker in the dye fields, made an attempt at stirring up his people. He worked to that end for over a decade but was ultimately captured and imprisoned due to [[Bluefingers\|Bluefingers']] information leaks and killed by [[Vasher\|Vasher]]. Bluefingers himself planned an extensive subversive campaign centered around starting a war between Hallandren and Idris: he brought mercenaries and Pahn Kahl [[Awakening\|Awakeners]] into the tunnel system below the court, manipulated [[Siri\|Siri]] into distrusting the Hallandren priests, and hired [[Denth's crew\|Denth's crew]] to increase tensions in the city. During this time, with the foreign peoples in T'Telir becoming more and more angry, T'Telir went through a period of increased security; the city guard increased patrols in the slums and even attempted to capture the slum lords. When his plans were nearing completion, he tortured [[Blushweaver\|Blushweaver]] and [[Lightsong\|Lightsong]] in order to get the Command phrases for Hallandren's Lifeless army, changed the Command phrase, and sent the army towards Idris. The attempted rebellion was defeated when Susebron, with his newly healed tongue, used [[Peacegiver's Treasure\|Peacegiver's Treasure]] to storm his palace with an army of Awakened cloths. Vasher decided to give him the Command phrase to Kalad's Phantoms, which he then sent after the Lifeless army.

## Trivia
Brandon wanted to use double consonants as a naming structure in Warbreaker, though he also wanted variety in the way in which names were written. Thus, we have apostrophes as in T'Telir, doubled up letters without an apostrophe as in Llarimar, and letters with a vowel in between as in Vivenna.
