The **Ten Essences** is the traditional [[Vorin\|Vorin]] term associated with both [[Soulcasting\|Soulcasting]] properties and the [[Herald\|Heralds]].

1 Soulcasting
2 Vorinism

2.1 Body Focus


3 Essences
4 Notes


## Soulcasting
Each Essence is connected to a particular [[Polestone\|gemstone]]. In order to [[Soulcast\|Soulcast]] (via [[Fabrial\|fabrial]]) an object into a new material, a Soulcaster must use the gemstone that corresponds to the new material's Essence.

## Vorinism
Modern [[Vorin\|Vorin]] teachings connect each Essence with a [[Herald\|Herald]] and that Herald's divine attributes. Ancient Vorinism also correlated them with the Orders of Radiants, although these correlations were not completely accurate. Each [[Stances\|stance]] used in [[Shardbearer\|Shardbearer]] combat is associated with an Essence.

### Body Focus
Vorin doctrine also associates each Essence with a "Body Focus" related to the human body. [[Khriss\|Khriss]] believes that the concept is attributable to Vorin philosophy rather than any actual aspect of Rosharan [[Investiture\|Investiture]]. However, it may in fact have some significance. Body Focuses do not directly correspond to [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgic]] bindpoints, but there is a loose relationship.
