The **Aztek Federation** is a nation on [[Earth (Rithmatist)\|Earth]] located in South America.
It seems there may have been multiple Aztek nations but the federation is spoken of as a single entity.

## History
Back before European explorers started exploring North and South America, the Azteks were attacked by [[Chalklings\|wild chalklings]] that came from North America, which tried to gain a foothold in South America. For an unknown period of time, the Azteks fought off the wild chalklings with an acid made from a local plant, and they sheltered refugees from the north.
The European explorers attempted to settle in South America, but were rebuffed. They headed for the [[United Isles of America\|Isles]] instead, but they were not warned about the chalklings by the Aztecs, who were generally reclusive and xenophobic at the time.
Some theorized that the Azteks built the [[Tower of Nebrask\|Tower of Nebrask]], but the Azteks refused to speak of Nebrask, and called it an abomination.

## Trivia
The sequel to *The Rithmatist*, *The Aztlanian*, will take place here.
