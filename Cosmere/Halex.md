She wears a matronly gown and a hat that is likely lined with [[Aluminum\|aluminum]]. She is unruffled by the presence of a constable in her establishment.
Mistress Halex opened her Soothing parlor in 341 [[Catacendre\|PC]]. In 342, [[Chapaou\|Chapaou]] fled to the parlor after his disturbing encounter with [[Bleeder\|Bleeder]] and paid for a private session. The [[Coinshot\|Coinshot]] that also worked for [[Ashweather Carriage and Coach\|Ashweather Carriage and Coach]] knew where he was and directed [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]] to the parlor.
