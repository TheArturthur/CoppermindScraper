## Geography and Ecology
>“
\-Tiny flowers grew in great blanketing swaths on the ground. Large, drooping pink blossoms hung from trees, like bundles of grapes, flowers growing practically on top of one another in a large cluster. Even the weeds had flowers.


Hanald encompassed large parts of the lowlands of modern day [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]], the rest being controlled by the [[Pahn Kahl\|Pahn Kahl]], They also controlled the highlands of modern day [[Idris\|Idris]]. It is bordered by the [[Bright Sea\|Bright Sea]] to the east. The capital city, [[T'Telir\|T'Telir]], still sits on the coastline and is a major trade center. The [[Tears of Edgli\|Tears of Edgli]] grow only in the soil of Hanald, and later [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]]. This is due to [[Investiture\|Investiture]] seeping into the ground from [[Endowment\|Endowment's]] [[Perpendicularity\|Perpendicularity]].

The valley has a moderate climate that is never too cold and rarely experiences harsh weather. While the mountains experience cold weather, and few warm summers. The climate in the valley allows food to be grown without difficulty, while agriculture is harder in the mountains due to the cold. Powerful earthquakes are a frequent occurrence in the valley. The growth of plants in this region is partly helped by [[Investiture\|Investiture]], much like the [[Elendel Basin\|Elendel Basin]].
The lowlands are inhabited by panthers, parrots, monkeys, and crocodiles. The Bright Sea is full of life, including many sorts of mussels, fish, and tentacled creatures. Elephants and zebras are said to be exotic creatures from "the south." While this is said during the age of [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]], these two kingdoms are in roughly the same place, so it can be assumed this is still valid. However it is unclear whether this means they come from southern Hanald or south of Hanald.
The northern mountains have vegetation that buds out in spring, though it only gets warm for a brief period each year. Some valuable roots grow high up in the mountains. There are fields and meadows with grasses and wild flowers. The air is crisp and chilly due to the elevation. A known type of flower is the Vanavel, the flower and the roots from this plant are eatable. There are also berry bushes in the highlands.

## Culture and Economics
### People and Religion
The people of Hanald were likely of [[Chedesh\|Chedesh]] origin, due to the kingdom being started by a group of [[Chedesh\|Chedesh]] men and women. There were probably some Pahn Kahl living in the kingdom, although they had their own kingdom as well.
The predominant religion was [[Austrism\|Austrism]], though back then it was very different from modern Austrism. Austrism back then hadn’t yet turned its back [[Awakening\|awakening]] and ostentation itself. This version of Austrism also believed in an afterlife of some sort. The Royal family followed it. At the same time the [[Cult of the Returned\|Cult of the Returned]] formed and began to worship the Returned, believing that each individual had been sent from [[Austre\|Austre]] in order to fulfill a mission. They were the individuals who discovered, maintained, and named Warbreaker the Peaceful and Glorysinger.

### Economy
>“*It controlled a uniquely lucrative region which, through the discovery and maintenance of the northern passes—combined with increasingly skillful navigation—was becoming a jewel coveted by the rest of the world.*”
\-Hoid describing Hanald

The new kingdom of Hanald flourished quickly, likely because of the dye trade, as Hanald was the only kingdom in which the [[Tears of Edgli\|Tears of Edgli]] grew, and also because of all the other products which can only be found in the jungles and mountains of Hanald.
Hanald was also situated on the shores of the [[Bright Sea\|Bright Sea]], opening many trade routes to other nations such as [[Tedradel\|Tedradel]]. Hanald’s capital was the prime port of T’Telir, further advancing trade. The mountains of modern day Idris were in its domain as well, and with it access to many minerals, including the only copper mines in the known world. These mountains also opened trade routes to the northern kingdoms, such as Kuth and Huth.

### Politics and Royals
The kingdom was ruled by either a King or a Queen. As the Idrian Royal family still does this it can be assumed that the eldest child, be it man or woman, inherited the throne. The first ruler was [[Vo\|Vo]]’s wife, who became Queen of Hanald after his death. Shortly before his death he impregnated her, starting the royal line of Hanald, the people of this line would rule Hanald for the next three hundred years.

Those of the royal family who either ruled or were potential heirs had the [[Royal Locks\|Royal Locks]]: hereditary hair that changes color according to the bearer's emotional state, at their will, or not at all when the bearer uses training and discipline to suppress the changes. Those with the Royal Locks can also grow them when they want to, and this feels to them as if they were using a physical muscle.
The servants of Hanald’s kings were killed when the kings died so they could serve in the afterlife.

### T'Telir
For more information, see [[T'Telir\|T'Telir]].
The capital of Hanald was called [[T'Telir\|T'Telir]], this was a large city somewhere in the east of the nation. T’Telir is located in a small bay on the shores of the [[Bright Sea\|Bright Sea]], protecting it from storms and making it an excellent port.
T’Telir has a monopoly on dye production from the [[Tears of Edgli\|Tears of Edgli]]. Other nations use the sea to bring exotic merchandise and fresh foods from their lands in trade.
The Royal family of Hanald resided in a large black palace in T'Telir,this building would later become the God King’s palace. During this time the palace was stark, built with odd twists and turns to confuse an invading foe.

## History
### Settling and expanding
The region that became Hanald was originally populated by the [[Pahn Kahl\|Pahn Kahl]] people, who lived in a collection of fishing villages. When the people of [[Chedesh\|Chedesh]], who dominated the world at the time, began exploring other parts of the [[Inner Sea\|Inner Sea's]] coastline, a group of their ships discovered this valley filled with jungles. One of the explorers, [[Vo\|Vo]], died and became the first [[Returned\|Returned]] while on one of the ships in the bay. He then died again a week later. Dismissive of the native Pahn Kahl, his crewmates founded a kingdom on the site and named it Hanald. they elected Vo's wife, who was pregnant with his child, as their queen.
The kingdom of Hanald quickly expanded, eventually claiming most of the lowlands as well as the highlands. They faced little resistance during this time, as the only other kingdom in the lowlands was Pahn Kahl, which wasn’t very mighty. The economy of Hanald grew quickly as well, likely because of the farming of the [[Tears of Edgli\|Tears of Edgli]] and other products native to the lowlands. At some point large mineral deposits were found in the northern mountains, Hanald founded mines in this region, this includes a number of copper mines.

### Tensions and the Manywar
The dye trade was one of the main reasons for Hanald’s quick growth, because of this the kingdom quickly started a stranglehold on the dye trade, making sure the trade was completely dependent on Hanald. Due to this relations with other kingdoms worsened.
The Royal family also turned it’s attention to the development of the relatively new art of [[Awakening\|Awakening]]. During this period major discoveries and developments were made in awakening. A lot of these discoveries were made by the [[Five Scholars\|Five Scholars]], a few examples include the command to make [[Lifeless\|lifeless]] with a single breath and the invention of [[Ichor-alcohol\|Ichor-alcohol]]. These discoveries allowed nations to build far larger and cheaper armies. Because many of these discoveries were made in Hanald the other nations grew scared as they would only get behind farther and farther as time passed.
At some point, one of the [[Returned\|Returned]] in Hanald had a vision of war. This ended up being the catalyst for a war, as it prompted [[Strifelover\|Strifelover]] to strike preemptively against the other nations.
[[Strifelover\|Strifelover]] used his knowledge of BioChroma and Awakening to raise up a vast army. In the beginning, it seemed the Royal family made Strifelover their general. However, he used this army, and the Royal family's own Awakeners and Lifeless, as well as a revolt of the people, to seize control of Hanald from them. The family promptly fled [[T'Telir\|T'Telir]], fleeing to the highlands.
What was to become known as the [[Manywar\|Manywar]] broke out. Hanald's main rivals, [[Kuth\|Kuth]] and [[Huth\|Huth]], were destroyed in the war, and Hanald itself was renamed a variation of its old name. The kingdom of [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]] was born in its place when [[Peacegiver\|Peacegiver]] established the line of the [[God King\|God Kings]]. Hanald's former royal lineage fled to the mountains and established the kingdom of [[Idris\|Idris]], thus splitting the kingdom of Hanald.
