**Iiaria** is a nation in the northern end of [[Darkside\|Darkside]] on the planet [[Taldain\|Taldain]]. It is the home of [[Skathan\|Skathan]], Darkside's emperor, and serves as the seat of power of the [[Dynasty\|Dynasty]].
Iiarians typically have dark brown skin, brown eyes, and dark hair. They have an identifiable accent when speaking the Dynastic language. [[Jon Acron\|Jon Acron]] considers Iiarians to be quite superstitious
Few specifics are known about Iiaria, but it is presumably the base of operations for the Dynasty's significant military strength, including a powerful navy and a [[Starcarved\|Starcarved]] army. Emperor Skathan also suppresses the spread of knowledge and technology within the Dynasty and strictly controls travel between nations, using an extensive network of assassins and spies to do so. Skathan himself has several magical abilities that are not well-understood.

## Trivia
In the original version of *[[White Sand\|White Sand Volume 1]]*, Khriss mentioned "Irarians" when describing the people living in [[Lonzare\|Lonzare]]. This was presumably a typo, as the dialogue was changed for the omnibus edition.
