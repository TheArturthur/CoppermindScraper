## Geography and Ecology
Marat borders the [[Southern Depths\|Southern Depths]] to the south, [[Tukar\|Tukar]] to the west, [[Emul\|Emul]] to the northwest, and [[Greater Hexi\|Greater Hexi]] to the east. The northernmost part of Marat includes the southernmost part of mountain range in the center of the continent. A river separates the border between Marat and Tukar. A grain similar to wheat that pulls down into burrows grows in Marat. Disc-like creatures with claws eat the grain then leave droppings with seeds to the east. The seeds grow into polyps, then blow back west to grow into grain.
Despite its low population, Marat has a few notable settlements. Along the Southern Depths is the city of [[Rossen Dar\|Rossen Dar]] and the towns of [[Jabom\|Jabom]] and [[Ja Dran\|Ja Dran]]. Near Tukar's border, there is the town of [[Khrishji\|Khrishji]], and close to Hexi there is the town of [[Mikhan\|Mikhan]].
Southern Marat has a notably low population, even compared to the rest of the area.
It has an area of around 524,000km.

## History
### Silver Kingdoms Period
During the Silver Kingdoms period of Roshar, the territory that would come to be known as Marat was part of [[Makabakam\|Makabakam]].
Eventually, Makabakam collapsed and, at an unknown point, Marat formed within its former territory.

### Age of Solitude
Over the Age of Solitude, Marat became famous for its furniture, rugs, and bazaars. Due to this, they became a centre of lucrative trade and commonly exported their products to nations across Roshar, including Alethkar.
[[Szeth\|Szeth]] visited the country during his exile.

### True Desolation
During the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], one of the first moves of the [[Fused\|Fused]] was to gather a large force of [[Singer\|singers]] in southern Marat. During their conquest, the singers pressed any survivors into labor at docks but allowed them to burn their dead. The Fused amassed a large naval fleet of over a hundred ships in the Marat ports and coves in preparation to launch an attack at [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]]. In the week before the assault, [[Venli\|Venli]] lived in a cave and told the story of the [[Listener\|listeners]] to the singers to prepare them to fight. The fleet left for Thaylen City during the surprise [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]] and returned after Odium's defeat.
[[Nale\|Nale]] brought [[Szeth\|Szeth]] and the other [[Skybreakers\|Skybreakers]] there to tell them the truth of the [[First Desolation\|First Desolation]].

## Politics
Marat is a tribal nation. Each city in the country is run by a leader referred to as elder brother, analogous to the [[Highprince\|highprinces]] of eastern nations. Marat's only contribution in global politics is its role as a waystop between [[Vorin\|Vorin]] and [[Makabaki\|Makabaki]] kingdoms. Marat has a low population compared to other countries, especially it its southern reaches. Some people in the east, including [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]], consider the Marati people to be barbarians.

### International Relationships
#### Alethkar
The Marati people have a stable trade relationship with Alethkar, exporting furniture and rugs.

#### Tukar
They appear to have a tense relationship with Tukar, with [[Szeth\|Szeth]] speculating that the Tukari might abandon their war on [[Emul\|Emul]] to attack Marat. The nature of this relationship, beyond the tension within it, is currently unknown.

## Culture
### Peoples
West of Marat, women's hands are not covered for modesty. Their clothes have colours similar to Azish patterns. The cloth is thicker and coarser then Azish clothing. Their outfits are also more enveloping then Azish clothing and have braided tassels that hang low from the waist. This style is common in southeastern Makabak.
The Marati are described as a rather proud people, like you would find in any other nation across Roshar.
Marati people are typically brown-skinned with black hair, much like the nearby Tukari.

### Economy
Marat has grand bazaars that attract merchants looking for lucrative trade. Some of Marat's exports are fine furniture and rugs. [[Highprince\|Highprince]] [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] used some to decorate his barracks. [[Queen Fen\|Queen Fen]] gave [[Shallan\|Shallan]] a fine Marati rug as a wedding gift. [[Mraize\|Mraize]] owns rugs from Marat.
