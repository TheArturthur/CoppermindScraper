**Pakson** is a crew member of the *Crow's Song* on [[Lumar\|Lumar]].

## Appearance and Personality
He is bald, though he is not of the age when that might be expected, and has an exceptionally weak chin. His legs seem too large in proportion to his torso, which makes him tall and awkward, especially on land.
Pakson is also a kind man who always thanks [[Fort\|Fort]] for his meals, no matter how bad they are. He regrets not learning how to play an instrument, as he has always loved music.

## History
Pakson was one of the "[[Dougs\|Dougs]]" that first pulled [[Tress\|Tress]] onto the *Crow's Song*, where he and his sister served as crew members. He checked on Tress periodically after her escape from the *Oot's Dream* while she clung to a porthole until she fulfilled the fifteen minutes [[Crow\|Crow]] set as the point at which the crew could pull her aboard. He was later killed during their voyage into the [[Crimson Sea\|Crimson Sea]] when a wave of crimson spores spilled over the deck and sprouted on contact with someone's vomit. He was impaled by many of the spores, was pinned to the outside of the captain's cabin, and bled out quickly. The crew took him down and cast his corpse into the sea before continuing their voyage. His death discomforted his shipmates, and both Tress and [[Salay\|Salay]] felt personally responsible for his death.
