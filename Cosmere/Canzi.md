## Religion and Culture
### Culture
The Cazzi people deeply valued the importance of death and mortality.
They kept a caste of slaves, on which the Lord Ruler based the lives of the skaa upon. Who they kept as slaves and how the system was systemically justified is currently unknown.

### Religion
The Cazzi are a people familiar with death, they teach of the beauty of mortality, the importance of death, and the vital function of the human body as a partaker of the greater divine whole. **Death chants** are among their practices. These chants are believed by the Cazzi to help free the spirits of the dead from their corpses, allowing them to return to the "**mountain of souls**".
They believe that all beings are part of a singular divine whole, and each body is a work of art created by a spirit that lives within the world. It is further taught that those with mental or physical disabilities have such disabilities due to being punished by the spirit for their evil. They believe in a form of body-soul dualism, teaching of a spirit which exists within the body and is capable of being separated from it. However, it appears that it does not naturally leave the body, and requires a death chant in order to free it from the flesh.
As they valued the vital functions of the body as a partaker in the divine whole, they kept detailed diagrams and descriptions of the human body.
Sazed used Cazzi teachings about the body to restore humans to their pre-ascension form.
