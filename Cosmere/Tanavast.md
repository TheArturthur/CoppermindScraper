>“*He loved humankind. He died defending you.*”
\-The Stormfather on Tanavast[7]


### Appearance
In one of [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin's]] visions, he appeared as a tall muscular man, thick of chest with dark skin and pure white hair; wearing billowing trousers and a waist-length coat, both of which seemed to be made of gold. Dalinar considered this clothing strange, which may indicate that it was from [[Yolen\|Yolen]]—or it may simply be a reflection of how style had changed since Tanavast recorded the visions.

### Personality
Little is known about Tanavast as a person, but the people who met him have an excellent opinion of him. He seems to be the only original Vessel with whom [[Hoid\|Hoid]] has a good relationship, and is, aside from [[Ati\|Ati]], the only one Hoid ever praises, calling him a decent person. The [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]] insists that Tanavast did love mankind, even dying to defend them. Tanavast himself seems to have been highly dedicated to his role as a deity and protective of humanity, even apologizing in visions for getting himself killed.
He appears to have loved mankind from the start, convincing the [[Dawnsingers\|Dawnsingers]] to give mankind a home after they fled from Ashyn following its destruction. For unknown reasons, he even turned against the Singers, becoming the god of humanity and abandoning his former followers.
Whenever mankind discovered the truth of the Desolations, he would comfort them and convince them that their fight was still justified. Arguing that it doesn't matter what their ancestors just did, only that they were defending themselves against a present enemy.
Late in his life, as his death grew near, he began to go insane, raving about Dawnshards and telling mankind that they would destroy Roshar like they destroyed Ashyn before. He also came to care more about oaths themselves, rather than the meaning behind it. This insanity directly led to the [[Recreance\|Recreance]]. Yet, despite his madness, he died defending humanity.
He was likely not prejudiced against [[Dragon (cosmere)\|dragons]], taking [[Koravellium Avast\|Koravellium Avast]], a dragon, as his lover.

## Attributes and Abilities
As a Vessel, Tanavast originally held as much power as his peers. At some point, however, he was weakened enough that, even with [[Cultivation\|Cultivation's]] assistance, [[Odium\|Odium]] was able to kill him. Like other [[Vessel\|Vessels]], he had Shardic future sight, though it was not as strong as that of Cultivation.

 
## History
### Before the Shattering
Tanavast was born and spent his early life on Yolen over ten-thousand years before the death of the [[Cinder King\|Cinder King]]. He was a regular mortal before he Ascended.
At some point in the past, likely prior to the [[Shattering\|Shattering]], Tanavast met [[Hoid\|Hoid]], and left a good impression on him. He also met and began a relationship with the [[Dragon (cosmere)\|dragon]] [[Koravellium Avast\|Koravellium Avast]].

### The Shattering
Tanavast was one of the seventeen people who shattered [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]], after which he Ascended as the Shard of Honor. After the Shattering, Tanavast and his lover, Koravellium Avast, moved to [[Roshar\|Roshar]], and both Shards Invested equally in the planet.
