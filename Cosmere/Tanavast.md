>“*He loved humankind. He died defending you.*”
\-The Stormfather on Tanavast[7]


In one of [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin's]] visions, he appeared as a tall muscular man with dark skin and pure white hair, wearing billowing trousers and a waist-length coat, both of which seemed to be made of gold. Dalinar considered this clothing strange, which may indicate that it was from [[Yolen\|Yolen]]—or it may simply be a reflection of how style had changed since Tanavast recorded the visions.
Little is known about Tanavast as a person, but the people who met him have an excellent opinion of him. He seems to be the only original Vessel with whom [[Hoid\|Hoid]] has a good relationship, and is, aside from [[Ati\|Ati]], the only one Hoid ever praises, calling him a decent person. The [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]] insists that Tanavast did love mankind, even dying to defend them. Tanavast himself seems to have been highly dedicated to his role as a deity and protective of humanity, even apologizing in visions for getting himself killed.

## Attributes and Abilities
As a Vessel, Tanavast originally held as much power as his peers. At some point, however, he was weakened enough that, even with [[Cultivation\|Cultivation's]] assistance, [[Odium\|Odium]] was able to kill him. Like other [[Vessel\|Vessels]], he had Shardic future sight, though it was not as strong as that of Cultivation.

## History
At some point in the past, likely prior to the [[Shattering\|Shattering]], Tanavast met [[Hoid\|Hoid]], and left a good impression on him.
Tanavast was one of the seventeen people who shattered [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]], after which he Ascended as the Shard of Honor. After the Shattering, Tanavast and his lover, [[Koravellium Avast\|Koravellium Avast]], moved to [[Roshar\|Roshar]], and both Shards Invested equally in the planet.
