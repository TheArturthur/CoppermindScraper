The **Geats** are a people from a land near [[Norweg\|Norweg]] and [[Dansic\|Dansic]] who successfully fended off the [[Hordamen\|Hordamen]]. They had strong runestones, which were instrumental in their fights against the Hordamen.
Presumably, it is this named after the Germanic tribe that lived in modern day Sweden through the medieval period.
