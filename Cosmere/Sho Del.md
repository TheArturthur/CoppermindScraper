## Appearance and Culture
Sho Del are roughly humanoid in appearance; however, they possess four arms and reptilian eyes. They are tall and limber, and their skin and hair are both chalk-white, with the hair being broad and flat, more akin to blades of grass than human hair. They are not a hive mind; in the [[Fain\|fain]] ecosystem of Yolen, they fulfill the same ecological niche as humans do in a non-fain one. Despite their connection to the fain, they are still able to venture out of it, and into the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]].
Very little is known of Sho Del culture. It seems that their names are always comprised of two parts, though it is unknown what, if anything, each half represents. They have multiple gods, and possess some sort of supernatural connection to them. It is unclear how that connection manifests, but it apparently makes them good navigators; as such, they are in high demand as guides through the Cognitive Realm. However, they are very rare out there. It is unknown if this is due to most of them preferring to remain in their home lands, or if they are a small group overall.
At some point, the planet [[UTol\|UTol]] was settled by Sho Del. These people were eventually met by human explorers from its twin planet, [[Komashi\|Komashi]].
[[Hoid\|Hoid]] apparently has interesting relationships with several Sho Del, though the specifics of it are unknown.

## Trivia
The Sho Del are one of the few elements of *[[Dragonsteel Prime\|Dragonsteel Prime]]* that are still part of the canon of the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]].
In *Dragonsteel Prime*, the Sho Del used silver sheaths for their swords; Brandon wrote that "intentionally" and it will probably still be a thing when he writes the [[Dragonsteel (series)\|Dragonsteel series]].
