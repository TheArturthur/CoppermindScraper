>“*Other methods must exist, as proven by the extremely large gemstone fabrials created by the Vriztl Guild out of Thaylenah.*”
\-A quote from Navani's lecture on fabrial mechanics[1]


The **Vriztl Guild** is a secretive guild of [[Artifabrian\|artifabrians]] based out of [[Thaylenah\|Thaylenah]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## History
The Vriztl Guild, using knowledge passed down via tradition for centuries, developed a method to transfer [[Light\|Light]] between [[Gemstone\|gemstones]] by using a tuning fork to vibrate the gems at the right frequency. They guarded the secret very closely, refusing to part with the knowledge even when [[Navani Kholin\|Navani Kholin]], giving a lecture on [[Fabrial\|fabrial]] mechanics to the [[Coalition of monarchs\|coalition of monarchs]], pleaded for them to aid the war effort by doing so. During the [[Singer\|singer]] occupation of [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]], Navani brought guild members [[Vrandl\|Vrandl]] and [[Ulvlk\|Ulvlk]] with her as a group followed the [[Sibling\|Sibling's]] directions towards one of its nodes. As they were stalled trying to open a door by infusing its gemstone, Navani impressed on the two Thaylens the need for haste. Ulvlk finally told Navani the guild's secret, though Vrandl believed that Ulvlk would be expelled from the guild for revealing their secret to the [[Alethi\|Alethi]].
