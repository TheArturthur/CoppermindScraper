Old **Jed** is a resident of a small village of the [[Eastern Dominance\|Eastern Dominance]].
He worked hard, even after the local nobility fled after the [[Collapse\|Collapse]]. He worked through the mists during the day right up until he was struck down by the [[Deepness\|Deepness]]. His corpse was twisted and the ground around him disturbed as he struggled in pain.
