**Tesuaka Tatomi** is a full [[Dreamwatch\|Dreamwatch]] member from [[Nagadan\|Nagadan]], and the daughter of a senator.
Tesuaka's team was summoned to [[Kilahito\|Kilahito]] from [[Jito\|Jito]] after [[Tojin\|Tojin]] reported a stable [[Nightmare\|nightmare]] previously encountered by [[Nikaro\|Nikaro]]. After their arrival, Nikaro attempted to warn them of an incoming army of stable nightmares, and Tesuaka mistook his knock at the door to be a delivery of ordered barbecue. Tesuaka was initially dismissive of Nikaro, but after the painter's continued insistence she paused her game of ping pong to cajole him with praises that he could one day join the Dreamwatch. Tesuaka was forced to seek alternative employment after the Dreamwatch disbanded.
