## Geography and Ecology
The country lies in the southern part of central Roshar, between an unnamed mountain range and the [[Tarat Sea\|Tarat Sea]]. It borders [[Tu Fallia\|Tu Fallia]] to the west and [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]] to the east. A single river splits the country in two. Despite a long coastline on [[Tarat Sea\|Tarat Sea]], it has no ports or settlements of global importance. It has an area of around 336,000 km.
The area around Triax and [[Tu Fallia\|Tu Fallia]] is incredibly lush compared to more eastern nations, such as [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]], these lands are full of plants with many varieties, such as grasses and vines. There are also many animals, one such species of animal has long tentacles and leathery skin instead of chitin.
Triax's position near the center of Roshar lends it significant strategic importance. For any military force seeking to cross the southern continent, the mountains to the north and the coast to the south form a bottleneck through Triax. This makes moving troops through through the area highly difficult, and provides a defending force with a strategic advantage. However, this advantage may be affected by control of the nearby [[Vedenar\|Vedenar]] [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]].

## Culture
#### Mining and Metals
It seems that the people of Triax don’t mine extensively, many of the villagers carry tools that aren’t made from metal.

#### Architecture
The people of Triax live in small villages, which are often located in forest clearings. Their houses are built on stilts, although the risk of flooding is quite small. It seems that most of the buildings in this area are overgrown with the same type of vine that covers the rest of the landscape.

## History
### Heraldic Epochs
During the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]] era, the region was split in half between [[Makabakam\|Makabakam]] and [[Valhav\|Valhav]].
Due to the Desolations, they were constantly returned back to early technological levels, often to the point to making use of stone tools. Though they advanced each time with the help of the Heralds whenever they returned, often helping them to enter into the bronze age, often receiving this assistance from [[Kalak\|Kalak]] and his [[Willshapers\|Willshapers]].

### Era of Solitude
At some point during the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]], the area that would later become Triax was invaded by the Veden king [[NanHar\|NanHar]], although he died during the war and was succeeded by his brother, [[NanKhet\|NanKhet]]. NanKhet died only three months later, giving way to the [[Siln\|Siln]] dynasty; it is unknown if the Veden conquest of Triax was successful, and whether or not it came to be ruled by the Siln dynasty.
Despite Triax's strategic importance, it seemingly became a relatively obscure country over time. There were no known cities of note, although some trade did occur in the area. [[Vstim\|Vstim]] purchased wormy grain in Triax at a large discount knowing that he could sell it for a profit in other lands. [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] did not have first-hand experience with Triax and other nearby countries, indicating that the area was probably not affected by the many skirmishes between Jah Keved and [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] during his lifetime.

### The True Desolation
During the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], the [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]] gathered in [[Marat\|Marat]] and then quickly struck at the strip of land bordering the Tarat Sea, including Triax. Contact with the country, including its [[Spanreed\|spanreeds]], was lost mere weeks after the arrival of the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]], implying that it was one of the first states that fell to the enemy. Following the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]], Triax remained under control of [[Odium\|Odium's]] forces. However, after a decisive victory by Queen [[Fen\|Fen]], Dalinar and his coalition maintained naval superiority in the south of the continent, allowing them to use [[Thaylen\|Thaylen]] ships to provide supplies to their troops in [[Emul\|Emul]] without needing to travel through Triax.

## Trivia
At around 336,000 km, it is a little smaller than the total area of Finland.
