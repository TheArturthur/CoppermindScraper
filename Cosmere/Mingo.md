**Mingo** is a rice-like crop grown on [[Komashi\|Komashi]]. The plant is a bush which, like other plants native to the world, has a magically reduced weight that allows it to float in the air on thermals from the hot ground. They have four broad leaves with a gas pocket under each, which can inflate and be used to provide the bush with some control over its movement. A cluster of seeds, of a deep blue-purple color, grows on top. These seeds can be boiled up into something that resembles rice, aside from the color.
Mingo is a staple food in [[Torio\|Torio]], where it is eaten with [[MaiPon sticks\|MaiPon sticks]]. After the activation of the [[Machine\|machine]], mingo bushes appear to have adapted to grow on the ground, with the help of [[Hion\|hion]].
