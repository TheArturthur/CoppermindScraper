**UTol** is a planet inhabited by [[Sho Del\|Sho Del]] in the [[UTol system\|UTol system]] of the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]]. It is noteworthy as one of few worlds to be inhabited by Sho Del and possibly for other reasons as well.
The world forms a double planet system along with [[Komashi\|Komashi]], and their barycentre orbits a large red-orange sun. The planet itself is covered primarily by oceans, with relatively few land masses.

## Relationship with Komashi
From Komashi, the planet appears in the sky as a pale, soft blue "star" known as the daystar; it is the only celestial body whose light is able to penetrate the [[Shroud\|shroud]]. Yumi considers the appearance of the daystar to be an encouraging omen from the [[Hijo\|hijo]].
[[Hoid\|Hoid]] does not fully understand how the light from UTol penetrates the shroud on Komashi, although he believes it is related to [[Virtuosity\|Virtuosity's]] [[Splinter\|Splintering]] in the region. The Splintering had the notable effect of creating the [[Hijo\|hijo]] on Komashi, but it is unknown if it affected UTol and its inhabitants.

### Research and Exploration
[[Nagadan\|Nagadan]] scientists on Komashi have been actively observing UTol, initially using telescopes and later employing a [[Hion\|hion]]-powered "[[Space bus\|space bus]]" to orbit the planet. Their surveys indicate that the Sho Del have some settlements on the planet's limited land masses, but primarily reside on the oceans, in boats. The Nagadan have not detected any radio signals from the planet, and theorize that UTol does not have any technologically advanced societies.
Shortly before the [[Battle of Kilahito\|battle of Kilahito]], the space bus landed on UTol and made first contact with the Sho Del, but the results of that meeting are unknown.
