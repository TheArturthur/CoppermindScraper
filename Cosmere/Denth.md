## Appearance and Personality
 by  Imaginative Joy 
For more images, see [[Denth/Gallery\|/Gallery]].
As a Returned Denth can change his appearance by will.
During the Pahn Kahl rebellion Denth appears as man in his thirties. He dresses in nondescript brown leather, but he keeps some color, such as his red vest. He has a long face and styled hair pulled back into a neat short ponytail. He keeps himself well groomed and is clean-shaven.
His overall outlook is cynical, likely colored by his own frustration that he finds himself having to do things he feels bad about. 

## Attributes and Abilities
As a [[Returned\|Returned]] Denth is faster and stronger than other people. He is also immune to most toxins and cannot die of old age.
Denth is a superb swordsman. He is so quick he can kill most people, even trained warriors, before they can react. Even accomplished fighters such as Vasher are clearly outmatched by him.
Denth understands [[Awakening\|Awakening]] on an advanced level, as one of the Five Scholars. He is also a very skilled awakener.
Denth is a consummate actor and manipulator, able to deceive [[Vivenna\|Vivenna]] and the other Idrians for months into setting up a war for him.
He has not travelled the cosmere widely.

## History
 by  ShiroXIX 
### Pre Rebellion
Little is known of Denth's life before he shows up in [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]]. Denth was originally known as VaraTreledees and was a scholar before the [[Manywar\|Manywar]]. He initially tried to stop the war, but ultimately took Vasher's side. He now hates [[Vasher\|Vasher]] for killing his sister [[Shashara\|Shashara]] and does not care that Vasher did it to protect the secret of [[Awakening\|Awakening]] steel.
Some time after the Manywar he took the name Denth and created a mercenary band with [[Tonk Fah\|Tonk Fah]], [[Jewels\|Jewels]], and [[Arsteel\|Arsteel]]. At some point Arsteel encountered Vasher and was killed by him. Denth took this opportunity to see how a dead Returned works as a [[Lifeless\|Lifeless]], and they renamed him [[Clod\|Clod]].
Denth has also spent time on the planet [[Roshar\|Roshar]], though when and for what purpose remains unclear.

### Pahn Kahl rebellion
>“*Unfortunately, Princess, we're here to kill you.*”
\-Denth to Vivenna [12]


Denth conspires with the [[Pahn Kahl\|Pahn Kahl]] rebels to overthrow the Hallandren government. Denth and his band infiltrate the [[Idrian\|Idrian]] spy network to kidnap [[Vivenna\|Vivenna]]. Acting as mercenaries working for [[Lemex\|Lemex]] they befriend Vivenna after poisoning Lemex to make it look like he died of illness. Denth uses Vivenna to increase tensions between [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]] and [[Idris\|Idris]] to drive [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]] to war. Later, after Vivenna is kidnapped by [[Vasher\|Vasher]], Denth and [[Tonk Fah\|Tonk Fah]] torture and kill [[Parlin\|Parlin]], Vivenna's friend to try and discover where she has gone. When Vivenna escapes from Vasher and returns to the safe house, she uncovers the truth about Denth and [[Tonk Fah\|Tonk Fah]]. In the ensuing confrontation, Denth is attacked by [[Clod\|Clod]] on [[Vivenna\|Vivenna's]] command, and she escapes. Denth catches Vasher while he is attemping to rescue Vivenna's sister [[Siri\|Siri]] who is living in the god king's palace. He has Vasher's sword [[Nightblood\|Nightblood]] thrown in the water so it can cause no further harm, then has Vasher hung by his wrists in a room with no color in the god king's palace to interrogate him. After retrieving Nightblood, Vivenna assists in [[Vasher\|Vasher's]] escape. Denth is killed by Vasher in a duel; Vasher stabs Denth after transferring what [[Breath\|Breath]] he had left into Denth in order to stun him. Vasher was not a better swordsman than Denth, and this was known by both characters.

### Death
During the [[Pahn Kahl rebellion\|Pahn Kahl rebellion]], Denth fights a duel with Vasher to prove that Vasher is not a better swordsman than [[Arsteel\|Arsteel]] or himself, and to find out how he won. Denth's fight with Vasher reveals that Denth is the better swordsman, however Vasher is more cunning. Vasher gives his [[Breath\|Breaths]] to Denth, effectively stunning him for a moment and Vasher runs him through with his dagger. As Denth dies, his hair flashes between colors, eventually falling to stark white. This reveals that Denth has the [[Royal Locks\|Royal Locks]], independent from being a [[Returned\|Returned]].

## Relationships
Denth was one of the Five Scholars. He was the brother of Shashara and sworn enemy of Vasher, another of the Scholars.
He is the leader of a mercenary band including [[Tonk Fah\|Tonk Fah]], [[Jewels\|Jewels]], and [[Clod\|Clod]].
He temporarily pretends to be employed by and allied with Vivenna.
He's actually in the employ of [[Bluefingers\|Bluefingers]].
## Trivia
Brandon considers Denth to be "the anti-[[Kelsier\|Kelsier]]", as they are both "glib, smart, and hired to do impossible tasks"; however, Denth, unlike Kelsier, is the antagonist.
