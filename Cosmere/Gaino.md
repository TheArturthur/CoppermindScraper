**Gaino** is a resident of [[Kilahito\|Kilahito]] on [[Komashi\|Komashi]]. He is a weightlifter and a friend of [[Tojin\|Tojin]], as well as a patron of the [[Noodle Pupil\|Noodle Pupil]].
Gaino once gave Tojin some advice regarding the lat press, which Tojin found very helpful. Yumi watches Tojin and Gaino interact while trying to get a better read on the former's character and interests. Tojin removes his shirt to show his muscles as evidence of the workout's effectiveness, and responds to Gaino's inquiry that he is doing four sets of twenty reps.
