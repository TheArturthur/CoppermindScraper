A day after Nomad skipped away, possibly to [[UTol\|UTol]], The [[Admiral\|Admiral]], Truth-Is-Waiting and some other members of the Night brigade arrived at [[Union\|Union]], posing as a ‘delegation’ from a town in a different corridor. During their time here, Truth-Is-Waiting was sent to talk to the natives to find out what they knew, after talking with them he returned to the stolen ship and reported what he had learned, which wasn’t much, he had however learned that there was a Scadrian research ship nearby.
After this they visited the Scadrians, trying to get as much information about [[Nomad\|Nomad]] as possible.
