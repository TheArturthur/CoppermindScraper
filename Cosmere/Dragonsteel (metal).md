**Dragonsteel** is a metal that forms part of the body of [[Dragon (cosmere)\|dragons]] in the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]]. It looks silvery and can appear liquid in the right light.
At least in the case of [[Xisisrefliel\|Xisisrefliel]], dragonsteel makes up a dragon's horns and claws, as well as spikes on its back and ridges along its neck and limbs. [[Hoid\|Hoid]] has speculated that the dragonsteel left on dragon corpses is the origin of the myth that dragons hoard material wealth.

## Trivia
[[Brandon\|Brandon]] has [[RAFO\|RAFO'd]] whether dragonsteel is the [[God Metal\|God Metal]] of [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]] and whether the silvery chain seen in [[Celebrant\|Celebrant]] is made of dragonsteel.
