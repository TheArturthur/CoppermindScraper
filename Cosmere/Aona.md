**Aona** was the original [[Vessel\|Vessel]] of the [[Shard\|Shard]] [[Devotion\|Devotion]]. Sometime after the [[Shattering\|Shattering]], she and [[Skai\|Skai]] took up residence on [[Sel\|Sel]]. [[Edgli\|Edgli]] believes that, by doing so, they violated the original Vessels' pact to not settle on the same world as another Shard, though the exact terms of that agreement are somewhat unclear. They were both [[Splinter\|Splintered]] by [[Odium\|Odium]] and their combined power forms the [[Dor\|Dor]].

## Abilities and Attributes
Aona was a [[Shard\|Shard]] of [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]], making her one of the most powerful entities in the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]]. Prior to being splintered she was immortal, unaging, and incorporeal. The [[Dor\|Dor]] is her and Skai's Shard pushed into the Cognitive Realm by Odium; it fuels the magics [[AonDor\|AonDor]], [[Dakhor\|Dakhor]], [[ChayShan\|ChayShan]], [[Forgery\|Forgery]], and [[Bloodsealing\|Bloodsealing]].

## History
Nothing is known about Aona's origins and life prior to the [[Shattering\|Shattering]], other than that she came from [[Yolen\|Yolen]]. For unknown reason, she and a group of others broke [[Cosmere\|cosmere's]] creator deity, [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]], into sixteen pieces. Of those sixteen, she took up [[Devotion\|Devotion]], and departed alongside [[Dominion\|Dominion]] for [[Sel\|Sel]].

When [[Raoden\|Raoden]] enters the [[Devotion's Perpendicularity\|pool]], he hears a voice, which may be that of Aona's [[Cognitive Shadow\|Cognitive Shadow]], though whether or not she even has a Cognitive Shadow is unknown.
