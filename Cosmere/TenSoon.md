## Appearance and Personality
>“*I don’t do … human very well anymore.*”
\-TenSoon [5]


TenSoon often takes the form of a wolfhound. Even when taking a human form, TenSoon speaks in a gravelly, rough voice and tends to growl at others. Post Catacendre, TenSoon has fallen out of practice talking with others. He also moves more awkwardly in a human form, as he is more accustomed to having a four-legged body.

## Attributes & Abilities
TenSoon is a kandra of the Third Generation. As such, he has no fixed body and can take on the form of someone as long as he has their bones. TenSoon has worked as a spy and imposter for a whole millennium and is able to impersonate somebody so perfectly that even their closest friends are unable to tell the difference. His ability to change forms is unmatched among all kandra, and he can change bodies within seconds. TenSoon was created with the [[Blessing of Presence\|Blessing of Presence]]. Later he gained the [[Blessing of Potency\|Blessing of Potency]] from [[OreSeur\|OreSeur]]. It’s unknown if he still has the [[Blessing of Potency\|Blessing of Potency]] after the Final Ascension.

## History
### Early Life
TenSoon was born in the third century of the Final Empire as a part of the Third Generation. TenSoon and the other Kandra tried to live among the humans, but the humans were afraid of the Kandra's abilities and began to hunt them. In the face of extinction, the Kandra offered their services to the people. TenSoon was present when the first service contracts were drawn up.

### Pre Catacendre

When Elend Venture returns from one of the balls, he sees his father, Straff Venture, in his office, speaking to TenSoon. At the time, TenSoon is wearing the body of a servant from House Hasting.
His [[Contract\|Contract]] was with Lord [[Straff Venture\|Straff Venture]], and was used by [[Zane Venture\|Zane Venture]] to imitate [[OreSeur\|OreSeur]], [[Vin\|Vin's]] kandra accomplice. He also took OreSeur's Blessing, the Blessing of Potency, after killing him. TenSoon retained possession of [[Kelsier's bones\|Kelsier's bones]] after OreSeur's death. He wore the bones of a  whilst in her 'service', and came to like them. He betrayed the Contract by telling Vin the secrets of the kandra, and by disobeying his master, Zane. He returned to [[Kandra Homeland\|Kandra Homeland]] and was imprisoned with [[ChanGaar\|ChanGaar]] and tried for his crimes. He rebelled and escaped to help Vin fulfil the prophecies of the [[Hero of Ages\|Hero of Ages]].
He encountered [[Sazed\|Sazed]] before this and imparted some knowledge onto him, who he saw as the "Announcer." He then took Sazed to the homeland of the Kandra.
After failing to make it back to [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]] and despairing, he turned back around and returned to the [[Kandra Homeland\|Kandra Homeland]] in time to help free [[Sazed\|Sazed]] from the treachery of the Second Generation. After this he took the true body of a fifth generation guard and once again played the part of another kandra in order to fool [[KanPaar\|KanPaar]]. His ruse succeeded until [[Ruin\|Ruin]] took direct control of his body and began to choke [[Sazed\|Sazed]] to death. This then forced him to carry out the [[Resolution\|Resolution]] and remove his own blessings, thus turning back into a [[Mistwraith\|Mistwraith]]. He was later restored, though his memories surrounding the event had degrading due to being without his spikes for over an hour.

### Post Catacendre
His actions in the events of the Catacendre came to be known by the kandra as the "Remarked Duplicity." He is known among Kandra for being the best impersonator and for the speed at which he can change bones. TenSoon has degraded memories from the time right before his spikes were removed.

[[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]] met TenSoon who was imitating Captain [[Brettin\|Brettin]] after the arrest of [[Miles Dagouter\|Miles Dagouter]]. Brettin was killed in an unrelated matter, so [[Harmony\|Harmony]] had TenSoon impersonate him. TenSoon did not have the opportunity to observe Brettin prior to his death, and so it was an imperfect impersonation. Those who knew Brettin could detect something off about him. TenSoon used Brettin's bones to submit a backdated request to the Senate for a citywide deputized forbearance for Wax. This freed Wax from any charges incurred during his investigation of the [[Vanishers\|Vanishers]], as well as granted him powers of investigation and arrest. He informed Wax of this action after Wax and Marasi's final confrontation with Miles. Brettin, still being impersonated by TenSoon, retired after Miles' execution, and presumably his bones were laid to rest.
During the hunt for [[Paalm\|Paalm]] he met Wax to guide him to the Kandra Homeland in an attempt to find more information on Bleeder. He first appeared in the form of a very large wolfhound and changed into a human form, then back to the wolfhound. Wax observed him change bones in mere seconds. He helped Wax escape from [[Chimera\|chimeras]] through the remnants of the [[Pits of Hathsin\|Pits of Hathsin]].
Slightly prior to and during the events of the attack on [[Elendel\|Elendel]] by the [[Set\|Set]] via the [[Pewternaught\|Pewternaught]] A16, He is revealed by [[Steris\|Steris]] to be imitating Constable [[Gorglen\|Gorglen]]. He acts as an intermediary between the Southern Scadrians and members of Elendel council during this time, making the decision to fetch the [[Bands of Mourning\|Bands of Mourning]] in an effort to try and stop the bomb that threatens Elendel. TenSoon stayed with Governor [[Varlance\|Varlance]] and Steris as they worked to evacuate the Elendel harbor and city, even when the Senators and Vice-Governor [[Adawathwyn\|Adawathwyn]] fled.

## Trivia
TenSoon's wolfhound form is that of a large, wolf-like dog -- not an Irish Wolfhound.
