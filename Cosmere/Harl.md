>“*What are you doing to my daughter? You [[Cremling\|cremling]], you storm's leavings! Don’t touch [[Miasal\|Miasal]]! Don't—*”
\-Harl, to Kaladin[1]


**Harl** is a thick-shouldered [[Darkeyes\|darkeyed]] man from [[Hearthstone\|Hearthstone]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## History
In 1166, Harl's daughter [[Miasal\|Miasal]] fell a long ways and was seriously injured. [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] happened to be walking by, and did his best to treat her wounds. Harl was beside himself with fear, and initially tried to prevent Kaladin from helping Miasal. Several other men dragged Harl away so Kaladin could work, but Miasal's wounds were fatal. When Harl realized that she had died he began shouting, shoving Kaladin aside and clutching his daughter's body. Harl wept holding his daughter's body for a long while.
In 1167, Harl, [[Balsas\|Balsas]], [[Luten\|Luten]], and other townspeople tried to rob [[Lirin\|Lirin]] of the [[Sphere\|spheres]] he got from Brightlord [[Wistiow\|Wistiow]]. Brightlord [[Roshone\|Roshone]] had convinced them that Lirin had stolen the spheres. Harl and the others were caught by Lirin outside his home, where he confronted them, using the light of the spheres to illuminate them. Harl wore a black mask, but he was recognizable by his broad shoulders. Lirin stood up to the men and shamed them for their behavior, and they left in disgrace.
At some point circa 1167, Harl's wife died from [[Scarfever\|scarfever]].
In 1168, with both his wife and daughter dead, Harl voluntarily enlisted in Highmarshal [[Meridas Amaram\|Meridas Amaram's]] army at the same time that other townspeople enlisted or were conscripted, including [[Tien\|Tien]] and Kaladin.

## Trivia
In early editions of *[[The Way of Kings\|The Way of Kings]]*, the man who confronts Lirin in the night was named **Horl**. This was a typo, and it was corrected in the leatherbound edition.
