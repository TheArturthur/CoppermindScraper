>“*It took hours to decide, but Restares is right--this is what must be done. For the good of Alethkar.*”
\-Amaram to Kaladin, on deciding to take the Shards for himself[1]


**Restares** is a member of [[Sons of Honor\|Sons of Honor]], possibly [[Meridas Amaram\|Meridas Amaram's]] superior, and likely one of the organization's leaders. Restares may have originally brought [[Gavilar Kholin\|Gavilar Kholin]] into the organization.
Gavilar briefly suspected on the night of his assassination that Restares tried to kill him, but never thought that'd actually happen.
Restares had a [[Spanreed\|spanreed]] to Amaram, which was sometimes carried by Amaram's carriage driver, [[Pama\|Pama]]. After [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] saved Amaram's life and killed [[Helaran Davar\|Helaran Davar]], Restares advised that Amaram take the [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] and [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]], and to kill the witnesses and pretend that Amaram personally won the Shards. The deliberation took hours, but eventually Amaram agreed, thinking it had to be done for the good of [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]]. This resulted in Kaladin's enslavement, and the deaths of the last surviving members of his squad, [[Hab\|Hab]], [[Reesh\|Reesh]], [[Alabet\|Alabet]], and [[Coreb\|Coreb]].
[[Mraize\|Mraize]] knew about Restares and referred to the Sons of Honor as Restares's cronies. Upon receiving a page of text from [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] about what Amaram knows, Mraize believed the Sons of Honor are also close to the secrets of the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] and [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]].
After the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]], Amaram wrote to Restares via spanreed that the Sons of Honor are successful in their goal of bringing the [[Voidbringer\|Voidbringers]] back to Roshar, with the hopes the [[Herald\|Heralds]] would also return. Amaram informed Restares of the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]] and the Voidbringers' red eyes.
