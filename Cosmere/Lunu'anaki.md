\-Hoid to Dalinar[4]


**Hoid** is a [[Worldhopper\|worldhopper]] and [[Dawnshard\|Dawnshard]] that travels the cosmere, originally born on the planet [[Yolen\|Yolen]] before the [[Shattering\|Shattering]]. He was one of the major figures in the [[Shattering of Adonalsium\|Shattering of Adonalsium]], but avoided taking up a [[Shard\|Shard]] himself, instead choosing to wander the cosmere pursing his unknown goals, often in the guise of a fool or storyteller. He may be guided at times by a mysterious sense about where he should go, but not what he is to accomplish there. One of his major goals is the defeat of Rayse, the original Vessel of the Shard Odium. While Hoid has generally avoided direct involvement in the major events of the cosmere, he is oftentimes present in the periphery, influencing in large ways and small the people who will go on to alter the course of history, as well as occasionally taking on an apprentice to train at his side. Hoid has been present for events such as the restoration of the city of [[Elantris (city)\|Elantris]] on [[Sel\|Sel]], the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]] of [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]], and the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]] of [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. Along the way he has gained access to a prodigious number of powerful [[Invested Art\|Invested Arts]] and arcana, including [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]], [[AonDor\|AonDor]], Awakening, and [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]], among others.

## Appearance & Personality
 
For more images, see [[Hoid/Gallery\|/Gallery]].
### Appearance
Hoid's appearance varies dramatically from book to book. He's often in disguise, which makes his true appearance difficult to ascertain. Couple this with the fact that he can Lightweave his appearance in order to look however he wants, it makes it nearly impossible to know for sure what he looks like. To the best of our knowledge, his face is lined, hawk-like and arrow shaped. Hoid is tall and thin and also has a sharp nose and jaw with delicate eyebrows. He tends to cock his head to one side and has keen blue eyes. Hoid's hair is white, though he was not born with that color and he occasionally dyes it. There is a particular reason for his hair being white.
When he is on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] during the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]] and [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], serving as King [[Elhokar Kholin\|Elhokar Kholin's]], and later Queen [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin's]] Wit, Hoid has the appearance of an Alethi man in his mid-30s with deep onyx hair. He wears a stiff black coat and carries a long thin sword at his waist. This blade is not magically Invested but has personal value to Hoid. It is a symbol of office for the King/Queen's Wit, though Hoid himself is not a skilled swordfighter.

### Personality
Hoid's true personality, while also usually disguised, is more easily seen as he occasionally drops whatever part he is playing. One of his overall most noticeable traits is his sharp wit and intelligence. The characters he plays often have a penchant for jokes and mockery but when he removes the facade his personality often seems mysterious and grave. Hoid would not consider himself a good man. Hoid is not always serious when he should be, due to how much normal human interaction bores him.
Hoid cannot directly physically harm people; this is an involuntary trait that is the result of changes to his spirit made during his time as a [[Dawnshard\|Dawnshard]]. [[Lunamor\|Lunamor]] says he cannot hurt man because it is forbidden by other gods. He also tells a young [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]], "You needn't fear me. I'm terribly ineffective at hurting people. I blame my upbringing." Hoid apologizes to [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] after beating him in a fight, stating he doesn't have the inclination to do real harm to him. This aversion causes him to be nauseated when thinking about physically harming someone, and is sometimes bad enough to incapacitate him. However, this only extends to physical trauma- Hoid has no issues with mentally hurting someone or through inaction. Hoid also has issues with harming himself physically, such as when he has to manipulate another man into punching him when he wants a tooth knocked out, rather than just doing it himself. If he had the capacity to, he would be willing to kill to achieve his goals, he would also let even those he cares about perish if it meant the furtherance of his goals.
Hoid is a very kind person to those he takes a liking to, doing his best to emotionally console them and give them the will to keep going. This can be seen in the various times he has told [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] stories in order to comfort him and teach him a lesson that he believes he needs to learn. He has done the same to Shallan, most notably when he met her as a child traumatized by her experiences and the abuses she went through during the [[Middlefest Fair\|Middlefest Fair]]. Here, he consoles her and gave her motivation to keep moving forward. He did the same later, when speaking with her in [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]]. He occasionally uses [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]] to help Soothe people.
While he is very comforting to those he likes, and can sometimes be open about some parts of his past; he does make sure that they never come to trust him too much, and that they understand what kind of person he is, and that they understand the dangers involved with getting to close to or trusting him.
On the other end, he finds great joy in tormenting those he hates, such as [[Ruthar\|Ruthar]], [[Rayse\|Rayse]], or Kelsier. This is likely a large part in his enjoyment of playing the role of court jesters like the King's Wit or the Imperial Fool. This behavior of his tends to rub many people the wrong way, making him despised by many people he interacts with. He sometimes bickers even with those he likes, such as [[Design\|Design]], though this takes the form of an exasperated fondness rather than bitter mockery.
He deeply enjoys storytelling, and has learned many stories over his long life. The stories he tells often have a personal or thematic relevance to those he is telling them to. Though sometimes, he simply tells stories for the sake of telling them, as he feels that as stories exist, they must be told. As a storyteller, he deeply hates when people spoil his stories. He also enjoys pontificating on the nature of art and storytelling to whoever would listen. He also enjoys asking people questions of philosophy and ideology, and would do so even with complete strangers. He uses these questions in order to use the answers of others as a jumping off point to share his own philosophy on the subject in question.
He also finds joy in is getting away with things.
As a child, he often stared at the stars and wondered about what they were and what it would be like to visit them.
For unknown reasons, he was willing to turn down the immense power of a [[Shard\|Shard]] when it was offered to him.
He has a very negative outlook on himself, often believing that he has no answers for others or even any answers at all, believes that he should never be trusted due to what he is willing to do to achieve his goals, he thinks himself arrogant and regrets many of his actions and inactions throughout his life, and he does not consider himself a good man. He even considers a Dawnshard itself to have become completely worthless in his wearing of it.
His ultimate goal is to "make that which once was," though the exact details are currently unknown.

#### Philosophy
He believes that the main thing that people value in creation is not the creation itself, but the novelty, timeliness, and originality of it. Observing that if two people make the same discovery independently, the one who reveals their discovery first is the one given credit and lauded for their innovation, while the second is considered a forger. That if two artists create similar works of comparable pulchritude independent of each other, one would be lauded and the other would be bemoaned as derivative. He claims that if it was truly a matter of the aesthetic beauty of a work, it would not matter which came first. From this, he claims that the idea that what is valued most is creative ability, wisdom, and invention to be nothing more than a lie that humanity tells itself. He admits that it is a rather cynical viewpoint, but holds to it regardless.
He feels that art and aesthetic beauty is not some eternal idea outside of humanity, but rather that it inherently relies upon and is defined by humanity. That art produced with low audience expectations can gain much love and loyal following from those given more then they expect; but conversely, an artist held in very high esteem can have their works torn apart and considered a failure for falling even slightly short from expectations. Aesthetic beauty is given definition through audience expectation and interpretation, it relies deeply upon audience participation, and therefore is not eternal and independent. He claims that this aspect of art makes it fundamentally unfair. He furthers this idea to say that the concept of expectation defining value extends to all parts of life, such as in financial gains.
He believes that all great art is necessarily hated by some due to the variety in human tastes. To make it so nobody would hate a work of art, one must remove everything that makes it special, therefore making it so that it is loved by nobody. Being hated is not proof that art is great, but not being hated is proof that it is not. He believes that art is about emotion, examination and going places people have never gone before to discover and investigate new things; it is from this definition of art, and his recognition of the subjective nature of aesthetic taste, that he argues that all great art is necessarily hated by somebody. When questioning himself on how many people need to love a work of art to outweigh the hate it inevitably inspires, and balance out the risk. Thus, if even one person loves a work, no matter how many people hate it, it is worthwhile.
He believes that stories don't live until they are imagined in someone's mind, and that everyone's experience of the story is individual and unique. He believes that the meaning of a story is up to the audience themselves to decide; that it is not meant to tell them how to think, but instead to give them questions to think upon. He thinks that the interpretations people have of stories are based upon what they themselves are looking for, as are the answers they find in them. His belief in how stories take on life in the minds of an audience is likely a reason for his feeling of obligation to tell the stories that he learns to whoever will listen.

He sees purpose as the spiritual conjunction that glues together human existence and volition. Thus, he sees it as a deeply important part of one's existence as a sapient being.

## Attributes and Abilities
> [!info] This page or section deals with theories or speculation.Please read carefully and note that this is not necessarily canonical.

  Creating illusions
Hoid does not yet have the abilities of every planet he's visited. Some of his powers predate the [[Shattering\|Shattering]], but none of them are gained through [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgy]]. Hoid is concerned about opening himself up to the influence of Shards, so he only gains access to manifestations of Investiture through more conventional, but more difficult ways. Hoid has access to multiple Invested Arts, but not an incredibly large number. He is likely the most powerful non-Shard entity in the cosmere, although a few of the older dragons and [[Aether\|aethers]] might rival him.
After [[Odium\|Odium]] stole some of his memories, Hoid instituted protection protocols to defend himself if something or someone tried to interact with his soul. This causes his body to be frozen in time, while his mind remains unaffected. In this state, he is still able to make [[Connection\|Connections]] with others, and may even see and hear from those he is Connected with. The physical stasis was not what Hoid intended to happen and it will last until the person stops trying to interact with his soul.
There are only a few things in the cosmere that are capable of hurting him, one of which is likely [[Nightblood\|Nightblood]], and he stays far away from all of them. Hoid also has an unknown [[Seon\|seon]].

### Illusions
>“*I see. You do not yet understand the nature of lies. I had that trouble myself, long ago. The Shards here are very strict. You will have to see the truth, child, before you can expand upon it. Just as a man should know the law before he breaks it.*”
\-Hoid on Lightweaving to Shallan[34]


Hoid has access to an Invested Art known as [[Yolish Lightweaving\|Lightweaving]] that originates from Yolen prior to the Shattering of Adonalsium. Lightweaving allows for the creation of optical and auditory illusions. This Lightweaving is much less restrictive than the later [[Illumination\|Rosharan variant]], and does not require a spren or Stormlight to function. Hoid sometimes makes use of this ability in his disguises although he has several ways of changing how he looks including practical effects. He may also make use of it in some of his storytelling, such as the pictures of [[Derethil\|Derethil]] and the *[[Wandersail\|Wandersail]]* that Kaladin sees in the smoke when Hoid is telling him a story.
Hoid's Yolish Lightweaving does not always seem to function perfectly on Roshar; in fact, he needs help from Shallan to fully craft an illusion. His power is somehow limited, and he has trouble making some aspects of it work, even after multiple attempts. It is uncertain why this occurs and whether or not this issue is unique to Roshar. Hoid's bonding of a Cryptic will provide abilities that supplement his own Lightweaving and allows him to overcome his issues crafting illusions, although further impacts or resonances between the two are unknown. Hoid's access to Yolish Lightweaving does allow him to guide another Lightweaver's power, although this is not something he would be able to do with just any Invested Art.

### Worldhopping
Hoid travels between various planets within the cosmere by making use of [[Perpendicularity\|perpendicularities]], places usually created by the presence of a Shard on a planet where the sheer power of Investiture causes the borders between the realms to be weakened. A knowledgeable person such as Hoid is able to transition from the Physical Realm to the Cognitive Realm. Hoid can then travel to a different world's subastral, as the distances between worlds in the Cognitive Realm are much smaller than in the Physical Realm. Hoid is very proficient at traveling in the Cognitive Realm. He can easily travel to any world that has an active [[Perpendicularity\|perpendicularity]], even those worlds where the perpendicularities are dangerous to pass through such as the [[Well of Ascension\|Well of Ascension]]. Hoid is known to be aware of perpendicularities on Scadrial, Sel, and Roshar, and likely knows of Nalthis's perpendicularity as well. While Hoid typically makes use of natural perpendicularities in his travels, later in life he may also have access to an ability that essentially allows him to generate his own personal perpendicularity, much like the [[Surge\|Surge]] of Transportation. Following the invention of space travel, he also makes use of spaceships to travel between planets.

### Dawnshard
>“*Other men . . . other men, as they age, merely grow stranger. I fear that I am one of those. I am the bones of a foreign species left drying on the plain that was once, long ago, a sea. A curiosity, perhaps a reminder, that all has not always been as it is now.*”
\-Hoid on his age[42]


Hoid held the [[Dawnshard\|Dawnshard]] with an intent diametrically opposed to the concepts of harm and violence for a long period of time. His time holding it caused changes to his spiritweb in a similar manner to [[Savant\|savantism]]. These changes meant that long-term, Hoid found himself unable to inflict harm on himself or any others, as well as unable to eat meat he believes was naturally produced (i.e., he could eat meat he believes was made in a lab or by magic). His Dawnshard is in some way connected to the [[First Gem\|First Gem]], his eponymous topaz. There were other side effects of the Dawnshard. Hoid held it for so long that not only is he ageless, it has become essentially impossible for him to die. While other people who have held this Dawnshard have gained the ability to Skip and teleport from planet to planet, Hoid has not for most of his life had access to this ability, and it is uncertain if he ever gained it.

#### Time-Dilation
In addition to his agelessness, Hoid has not actually experienced all those years, instead making use of some time-dilation technique that may render him somehow unconscious or unaware. However, Hoid does not have the ability to travel backwards in time.

### Healing Factor
>“*I'd be surprised if that little knife of yours poses me any real threat, Kholin.*”
\-Hoid to Jasnah on her Shardblade[15]


Hoid has access to some sort of healing factor that is capable of repairing both the body and the [[Spiritweb\|soul]]. He is able to regenerate any damaged body parts at will, including his head. He can also heal from being stabbed [[Hemalurgy\|hemalurgically]]. Hoid is able to repress his healing factor in some way, preventing instantaneous healing, an ability that he makes use of in some of his disguises. This healing factor makes it very difficult to kill Hoid, although he is still at least somewhat vulnerable. The name of the manifestation of Investiture responsible for Hoid's healing is unknown, but it is ancient, likely originating from some Pre-Shattering source. It is uncertain whether or not this healing factor is at all related to Hoid's apparent agelessness, which is known to originate from a remnant of a weapon built to kill Adonalsium. Hoid is unafraid of Shardblades for multiple reasons, probably including his healing factor.

### Fortune
>“*I have discovered a place that I must be, though to be honest I'm not exactly sure why I need to be there. This doesn't always work as well as I'd like it to.*”
\-Hoid to Dalinar[4]

Hoid has access to an ability that allows him to make use of the Spiritual attribute of [[Fortune\|Fortune]], which grants him a limited amount of foresight. Hoid's Fortune ability gives him an innate knowledge of where and when he needs to be. While this ability may grant him knowledge of what he is to do, usually Hoid does not know why his ability has brought him to a specific place. Hoid's Fortune ability is not infallible; occasionally it directs him to go somewhere, but either nothing notable is happening or he is unable to discover the reason why he has been led there. Hoid's fortune ability has let him know about instant noodles, although he has had prior experience with them on Taldain.

### Connection
Hoid has access to some manifestation of Investiture that allows him to manipulate the Spiritual attribute of [[Connection\|Connection]]. The full extent of this ability is unknown, but its primary known use is to help Hoid speak the various languages of the worlds of the cosmere that he visits. The ability allows him to Connect to whatever land he is in, temporarily altering his Spiritual aspect to believe that he was raised in that place, allowing him to speak as a native. While Hoid has learned naturally how to speak some foreign languages, and is decent with languages, he desires to pass as a local oftentimes, which requires something beyond natural learning. Generally he makes use of his Connection ability to communicate in foreign languages. This ability is not without fault though, as when Hoid speaks naturally it will fill in local idioms and phrases on its own, but if Hoid is careless and focuses on a specific word or phrase the ability may fail and he will say the word verbatim in his own tongue or it may be said in an odd way. Hoid is an expert in using his Connection ability, but even he sometimes makes mistakes. This is the reason he occasionally slips up and may say words that confuse others, such as "coin" and "bunny" on Roshar. As Hoid has demonstrated the ability to fluently speak foreign languages before the knowledge of unsealed metalminds became widespread, it is unlikely that he is making use of Feruchemical [[Duralumin\|duralumin]] to manipulate Connection.

#### Visions
Hoid, via unknown means, is able to enter and exit certain [[Visions\|visions]], as well as bring those he is bonded with, like Design. While doing so, he creates a large, pure white bubble of light, which can shelter those who have been brought into the vision naturally. While in the vision, Hoid is able to create whatever objects he wants. Hoid is only able to do this for roughly twenty minutes before being detected.

 
### Metallic Arts
Hoid has also gained access to Allomancy, by burning a bead of lerasium stolen from the Well of Ascension. This grants him power equivalent to that of the ancient Allomancers. It is uncertain how practiced he is with these powers, but he does make use of emotional Allomancy on at least one occasion. He also has access to [[Atium\|atium]]. It is unknown whether or not Hoid has access to [[Feruchemy\|Feruchemy]]. However, he does have access to some unkeyed metalminds, which would not be useful to him without Feruchemical abilities or unsealed metalminds. The particular attributes that are stored in these metalminds are unknown. Hoid does not make use of Hemalurgy, to gain access to the Metallic Arts or any other manifestation of Investiture, as he is concerned about opening himself up to the influence of Shards. He does, however, own many Hemalurgic spikes.

### Awakening
>“*Perfect pitch makes this all so much easier than it once was....*”
\-Hoid to Kaladin on making music[18]


As a Yolish man, Hoid was not himself born with any [[BioChromatic Breath\|BioChromatic Breath]]. However at some point Hoid has gained access to enough BioChromatic Breath to bring him to at least the Second Heightening. This means Hoid has at least two hundred Breaths, which grant him the ability to recognize unsupressed Breath auras and judge about how much breath another Awakener has, as well as perfect pitch. That is not to say that Hoid may not have reached a higher Heightening, just that the second Heightening is his minimum power level. Hoid's level of skill with [[Awakening\|Awakening]] is still unknown, as he has only made use of it on one known occasion, when he Awakened a doll, causing it to walk. This makes it difficult to ascertain his knowledge of Commands or complex Awakenings. Hoid's level of control over Investiture does allow him to suppress his Breath aura, making it difficult to be noticed by others. However, there are various methods of detecting Investiture that could circumvent this suppression. Hoid's perfect pitch does aid him in tuning instruments and making music. Additionally, holding Breath has allowed Hoid to outsource centuries of his memories to said Breath. After [[Odium\|Odium's]] destruction of some of these Breaths in order to wipe his short-term memory, his level of Breath was reduced to just under the Second Heightening, resulting in a loss of perfect pitch.

### Surgebinder
  Hoid with <<Design\|Design>>
>“*It's either go with me now or wait it out and get captured. I honestly don't even know if you've the mind to listen. But if you do, know this: I will give you truths. And I know some juicy ones.*”
\-Hoid to his Cryptic, Design[16]


Hoid has bonded the [[Cryptic\|Cryptic]] [[Design\|Design]], which grants him access to Surgebinding. While the enhanced reflexes and healing permitted by Stormlight will likely be less useful to Hoid, the [[Nahel bond\|Nahel bond]] allows him to access the surges of [[Illumination\|Illumination]] and [[Transformation\|Transformation]]. This allows Hoid to [[Soulcast\|Soulcast]], transforming one type of matter to another by persuading its Cognitive aspect as well as Lightweaving, which grants him the ability to create visual and auditory illusions. This Rosharan Lightweaving seems to have a compounding effect with his Yolish Lightweaving, and allows him to circumvent the problems that he has experienced with his own illusions. Although Hoid's Ideals are unknown, he has admitted some truths. This may eventually grant him a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] and [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]], and he likely has access to at least a Shardblade from their bond.
Out of all of the orders of the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]], [[Order of Lightweavers\|Lightweaver]] was his first choice, as Lightweaving matches him very well and he's quite familiar and experienced with it. Having full access to Lightweaving is a fulfillment of a long, long quest for him.

### Elantrian
>“*It was constructed of Aons. Which I could now draw.The mechanics might bore you. The results, though, were spectacular.*”
\-Hoid's narration, Tress of the Emerald Sea[17]


Hoid became an [[Elantrian\|Elantrian]] through winning a bet he made with [[Riina\|Riina]], a member of The [[Ire\|Ire]]. Despite his short time with the power, Hoid showed a notable aptitude for the manipulation of [[Aon\|Aons]], being able to edit a complex [[AonDor\|AonDor]] "curse" placed on [[Charlie\|Charlie]] by Riina, who herself is a highly experienced wielder of AonDor. Additionally, Hoid was shown to have spent significant time coveting this specific Invested art.
His knowledge of AonDor is strong enough that he is able to hack the system in order to use it off of [[Sel\|Sel]].

### Storytelling Method
Hoid tells stories with smoke and sand.

#### Sand
On Nalthis, [[Lightsong\|Lightsong]] calls Hoid to tell the story of [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]] history to him and [[Siri\|Siri]]. As he told the story, he dropped sands, dusts, and small objects, mixing them together to produce various effects.
He began by trailing sand out of his hand, then he added a powdery black sand, when both trails mixed it became a white sand. He began to scatter fern leaves and then threw the handful up with blue and deep red dust making it seem like a minor explosion. He sprinkled silver glitter in front of him, then trailed powdery brown dirt. Black dust, and then [[Tears of Edgli\|flower petals]]. He then sent out a spray of half a dozen colors from both hands. Then bright yellow dust from one hand and black from the other. Torn writing on paper, followed by metal bits, black charcoal dust from both hands, he crumbled clay, sprinkled golden dust around, bits of grass and earth, a white powder and then a spray of water that turned into mist.

#### Smoke
While telling stories with smoke he uses a flute, blowing the smoke, it may be [[Yolish Lightweaving\|Yolish Lightweaving]] that causes patterns and images to appear in smoke.
On Roshar, the chasms echoed the music allowing him to speak and play, without the music ever seeming to stop. It is unclear how the flute could be used without chasms or canyons.

## History
### Origins
>“*Other men . . . other men, as they age, merely grow stranger. I fear that I am one of those. I am the bones of a foreign species left drying on the plain that was once, long ago, a sea. A curiosity, perhaps a reminder, that all has not always been as it is now.*”
\-Hoid on his age[42]

The individual who would later become known as Hoid was born on [[Yolen\|Yolen]] sometime prior to the [[Shattering of Adonalsium\|Shattering of Adonalsium]]. He was born naturally and his parents were married. From an early age he developed a fascination with the topic of whether life existed on other planets and often listened to local philosophers debate the topic.
During this period before the Shattering, Hoid learned [[Yolish Lightweaving\|Yolish Lightweaving]], which sometimes got him into trouble. Some of his oldest aliases, one of which likely came from a former master of his, also date back to this period; among these are Hoid, which he says he stole from someone he should have loved, and Cephandrius Maxtori.
Eventually, Hoid met the [[Dragon (cosmere)\|dragon]] [[Frost\|Frost]], who is his elder by a small amount, though Hoid may have already started aging strangely by that time. Shortly thereafter, Hoid also met the people who would become the sixteen original Vessels. His early relationships with the future Vessels seem to have been amicable; he went out for drinks with [[Tanavast\|Tanavast]] at least once, considered [[Ati\|Ati]] to be a kind and generous man, and became friends with [[Rayse\|Rayse]].

  A depiction of the <<Shattering of Adonalsium\|Shattering of Adonalsium>>
At some point, for a variety of reasons, the future Vessels resolved to kill [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]]; Hoid considered doing so to be somewhat necessary and was only loosely involved in their plan, though he was present for the actual Shattering. At the Shattering, he was offered one of the newly-created [[Shards\|Shards]], which he refused; even millennia later, he regards this as having been a wise decision because it allows him a greater degree of freedom.
In his conversations with the new Vessels, he implied that his rejection of a Shard meant he would not interfere with their affairs, though given his interest in being able to do as he pleased it seems unlikely he actually intended to leave them alone. The Shattering appears to have been a turning point in his relationships with many of the Vessels, as he seems to look down on them for being so eager to Ascend, while [[Edgli\|Edgli]] at least looks down on him continuing to involve himself in the affairs of the cosmere after refusing a Shard; additionally, the Shattering may be the origin of his grudge against Rayse and [[Bavadin\|Bavadin]].
At some point early in the history of the cosmere, Hoid held a [[Dawnshard\|Dawnshard]]; this Dawnshard appears to have been associated with a piece of topaz. Hoid apparently attempted to do something more with the gemstone for a long time, but ultimately was forced to admit that it had become worthless because he wore it. His association with this gem earned him the name Topaz and the title Bearer of the First Gem. Holding a Dawnshard also permanently altered Hoid's [[Spiritweb\|spiritweb]]; among other things, these alterations make him unable to harm others or consume meat, allow him to heal from nearly any injury, and are likely the cause of his immortality.
Hoid's involvement in important events early in the history of the cosmere has had significant effects on his relationship to Investiture. The fact that he comes from before the Shattering, when magic worked much differently, makes Investiture sometimes act oddly with regard to him; the Shattering also appears to have changed magic such that his Yolish Lightweaving is no longer fully functional. Additionally, his connection to certain events involving the Dawnshards makes some uses of Investiture particularly dangerous for him.

### The Desolations
At some point after the Shattering, Hoid visited Roshar and mingled with the original inhabitants of the world, even dancing with the ancient [[Singer\|singers]]. He grew to be close with one singer known as [[Vatwha\|Vatwha]].
He knew the Heralds, and they recognize him by the name Midius. He was the one that taught them how they could use Investiture to enhance their memories. Whether he knew them before or after the [[Oathpact\|Oathpact]], or the exact nature of their relationship, is unclear.
Hoid came to be worshipped by the [[Unkalaki\|Unkalaki]] as *Lunu'anaki*, the god of travel and mischief who cannot hurt man.
Hoid founded the [[Worldsingers\|Worldsingers]], and has the rank of Master Worldsinger, and at some point in the early Sixth Epoch, he took [[Senne Khald\|Senne Khald]] as his apprentice, and assigned her with the task of writing a treatise on all the Radiant Orders.
He has been to Aimia at some point.
Hoid attempted to bond a Nahel spren at some point before the Recreance, possibly during a Desolation, but presumably failed.

### Crisis in the Diem
Hoid traveled to [[Taldain\|Taldain]], though for what reasons are unknown. He was there when the [[Taishin\|Taishin]] were deciding whether or not to disband the [[Diem\|Diem]]. Hoid later got onto the boat [[Khriss\|Khriss]] took to return to [[Darkside\|Darkside]], where he sang a song to the passengers about the meaning of art.

### The Restoration of Elantris and Theft of the Moon Scepter
>“*There is beauty in every disaster, friend, if you are clever enough to find it.*”
\-Hoid to a skaze[77]


Hoid traveled to [[Sel\|Sel]], likely making use of [[Devotion's Perpendicularity\|Devotion's Perpendicularity]] in [[Arelon\|Arelon]]. Hoid spoke to the [[Skaze\|skaze]], and seems to have made some sort of agreement with them hinging on his desire to become an Elantrian with the restoration of [[Elantris (city)\|Elantris]]. Hoid disguised himself as a beggar, wrapped in bandages. He helped [[Sarene\|Sarene]] smuggle weapons into Elantris. Following the restoration of the city by Raoden, Hoid traveled to the Pool to meet a skaze. He removed his bandages, hoping to find himself transformed into an Elantrian, but the transformation had not occurred. The skaze ridiculed Hoid for his failure, but Hoid expressed his joy that secrets still remained unknown to him and then entered the Perpendicularity and transitioned to the [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive Realm]].
Hoid returned to Sel several years later, and found himself a position in the court of Emperor [[Ashravan\|Ashravan]] in the [[Rose Empire\|Rose Empire]] as the Royal Fool. He allied himself with the [[Forger\|Forger]] [[Shai\|Shai]] in her attempt to steal the [[Moon Scepter\|Moon Scepter]], an artifact that allows for the translation of the various symbols of Selish Investiture. He arranged for her to be caught after she'd left the Gallery with the Scepter, later using her duplicate to steal the scepter for himself. Hoid stole the Moon Scepter in order to help him translate between various symbols and gain access to the magics on Sel.
At some point, he and Shai ran into each other once again, after Shai devoted herself towards finding him again to take her revenge.

### The Collapse of the Final Empire and Catacendre
Hoid arrived on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]], likely through Ruin's perpendicularity in the Pits of Hathsin. He took up the guise of an informant, pretending to have bad eyesight in order to make himself less threatening to people seeking information from him. At some point he became known to both [[Dockson\|Dockson]] and [[Ashweather Cett\|Ashweather Cett]]. [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]], pretending to be a nobleman, contacted Hoid in 1022 [[Final Empire\|FE]], requesting information on House Renoux. Hoid (closed shop, smoking tobacco) met with Kelsier on the streets of Luthadel and told him that House Renoux was buying large amounts of weapons and armor from various noble houses and that Lord Renoux was considering a marriage between Valette and Elend Venture. He also claimed that Renoux was rumored to have some sort of leverage on Venture and that he knew [[Shan Elariel\|Shan Elariel]] to be a [[Soother\|Soother]]. At some point following this, he left Scadrial to attend to other business, again likely via the Pits.

  <<Kelsier\|Kelsier>> and Hoid's meeting at the <<Well of Ascension\|Well of Ascension>>
Around a year later, in 1023 [[Final Empire\|FE]], Hoid returned to Scadrial, traveling through Scadrial's subastral, riding on the back of a [[Cognitive Shadow\|Cognitive Shadow]] to the Well of Ascension, Preservation's Perpendicularity. He was using an oar coated with a strange glowing substance connected to the substance drunk by members of the [[Ire\|Ire]]. He encountered the Shadow of Kelsier, who asked for help returning to the Physical Realm. Hoid told him that there was nothing to be done, but he challenged Kelsier to an insult battle, with the prize being the true answer to one question. Kelsier instead threatened Hoid. Hoid attempted to enter the pool, but Kelsier attacked him. Hoid easily overpowered Kelsier and caused him serious pain, but not permanent injury. Hoid then transitioned through the Well and stole a bead of [[Lerasium\|lerasium]] from the adjacent room. He later consumed the lerasium and became a [[Allomancy\|Mistborn]]. When Kelsier spoke of the incident to Preservation, Preservation spoke briefly on Hoid, calling him Cephandrius. Later, Kelsier told [[Khriss\|Khriss]] and [[Nazh\|Nazh]] about his meeting with Hoid, and they seemed distressed to know that he had arrived and stolen a bead of lerasium.
Hoid then traveled to the [[Terris Dominance\|Terris Dominance]] to figure out [[Feruchemy\|Feruchemy]], and then became wrapped up in matters he did not anticipate. This may refer to him becoming involved after the [[Inquisitor\|Inquisitor]] attack on [[Tathingdwen\|Tathingdwen]] and the slaughter of the [[Synod\|Synod]]. Hoid took up the guise of a Terris leader and led the Terris refugees to the Central Dominance.
A year later, in 1025 [[Final Empire\|FE]], Hoid was in [[Fadrex City\|Fadrex City]], again acting as an informant, and Ashweather Cett suggested Vin speak to him. Just before Vin arrived, Kelsier's Cognitive Shadow noticed Hoid from within the Cognitive Realm. Kelsier tried to touch Hoid's soul, but was rebuffed by a shock that numbed his hand. At that moment, Vin arrived intending to meet with Hoid, but Kelsier attempted to warn her away. Since he was in the Cognitive Realm, he couldn't communicate with her directly, but she did sense that something was off about Hoid and instead chose not to speak to him.
He has travelled to Scadrial several times between the Catacendre and the True Desolation, but actively hid from [[Harmony\|Harmony]]. During these visits he accomplished much, but what exactly he was doing is currently unknown.

### The Pahn Kahl Rebellion
Several centuries later, around [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]] year 327, Hoid traveled to [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]] and took the role of a master storyteller. [[Lightsong\|Lightsong]] summoned him to the [[Court of the Gods\|Court of the Gods]], where he recounted the story of [[Vo\|Vo]], explained the origin of the Hallandren God Kings, and answered Lightsong and [[Siri\|Siri's]] questions. He likely achieved perfect pitch while on this world by obtaining additional Breaths. At some later point, [[Vivenna\|Vivenna]] also met Hoid; she later described him as one of the only people on Nalthis that is cosmere-aware.
Hoid spent a lot of time gambling on Nalthis, and was fairly renowned. He would arrange things so that he could never lose, and then bet everything on himself. However, someone else managed to arrange it so that he couldn't *win*, either, resulting in a tie and the loss of his winnings.
[[Vasher\|Vasher]] once met Hoid when he was using the alias "Dust", several years before Vasher's activities on Roshar.

### Obrodai
Hoid visited [[Obrodai\|Obrodai]] at some point prior to the True Desolation. A female avatar was created by [[Autonomy\|Autonomy]] and instilled with a great dislike of Hoid in order to prevent him from returning there.

### Prelude to the True Desolation
>“*I've come to your land to chase an old acquaintance, but I end up spending most of my time hiding from him instead.*”
\-Hoid to Kaladin.[21]


According to [[Cord\|Cord]], when her grandmother served as watcher of the [[Cultivation's Perpendicularity\|pool]], Hoid warned the [[Unkalaki\|Unkalaki]] about the [[Sleepless\|Gods Who Sleep Not]].
[[Rock\|Rock]] also described an encounter with him in the [[Horneater Oceans\|Horneater Oceans]].

  Insulting the <<Lighteyes\|lighteyes>>
In a departure from his *modus operandi*, Hoid played a more conspicuous role in the events on [[Roshar\|Roshar]], as his goal was to become a Radiant. He has been to Threnody at some point before this visit to Roshar.
At some point, [[Sigzil\|Sigzil]] became his apprentice. As master and apprentice, they traveled all across Roshar, including to [[Babatharnam\|Babatharnam]]. He had to pay to have Sigzil freed from prison on three separate occasions. This relationship essentially ended after Sigzil attempted (and failed) to kill somebody and wound up punished via being made into a slave and bridgeman.

>“*Keep cutting away at those thorns, strong one, and make a path for the light.*”
\-Hoid to Shallan[34]

In Palah 1170 during the [[Middlefest Fair\|Middlefest Fair]] in [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]], [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] met Hoid disguised as a messenger, and he spoke with her. Seeing that she was emotionally distressed, he used emotional Allomancy in order to soothe her, and encouraged her to keep on pushing forward despite her struggles. This meeting would leave a deep impression upon Shallan, and she would remember him for years after the event.
He met [[Lift\|Lift]] at some point after her blessing by the [[Nightwatcher\|Nightwatcher]] in 1170, but before her heist on the [[Bronze Palace\|Bronze Palace]] in 1173. She was fond of him, and they parted ways when he jumped into the mouth of a [[Greatshell\|greatshell]].
[[Ishikk\|Ishikk]] was hired by three men from the [[Seventeenth Shard\|Seventeenth Shard]] to search for Hoid in the [[Purelake\|Purelake]], though all four failed to find him. He searched for five months, though came up with no results.

#### The War of Reckoning
Only a few months before the greatshell hunt on Kakabach 1173, he became the King's Wit, [[Elhokar Kholin\|Elhokar Kholin's]] court jester. As the king lived at the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] in order to better lead his people during the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]], Wit spent most of his time at the plains. He was aware of Sigzil being held in slavery at the plains, but still avoided interacting with him, though not necessarily out of a lack of care.
Through his role as Wit, he kept his eyes upon and influenced [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]], going so far as to ask him if he has ever heard the term "Adonalsium", as he believed that he was involved in secret societies such as the [[Sons of Honor\|Sons of Honor]], and thought that [[Gavilar Kholin\|Gavilar Kholin]] confided in him; his suspicions were proven wrong.
He also told [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] the story of [[Derethil\|Derethil]] and the *[[Wandersail\|Wandersail]]* on Tanataches 1173. During the course of the story, Hoid uses a special, ancient flute called a [[Trailman's flute\|Trailman's flute]]. It is also likely that he used his [[Yolish Lightweaving\|Yolish Lightweaving]] to cause the smoke from the fire to take the form of various elements from his story. He told the story in order to teach Kaladin to take responsibility. As he sent him off, he gave him his Trailman's flute, and asked him to take care of Sigzil.
Hoid was in [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] when [[Taln\|Taln]] arrived to herald the coming of the [[Desolation\|Desolation]] on Tanatabah 1173. Before his arrival, he was discussing with a few guards the nature of [[Virtuosity\|creativity]], [[Invention\|invention]], and wisdom, and the deep importance in novelty and timeliness in all three. When he arrived, he apologized to his old friend, remarking that he was already too late.

  <<Shallan\|Shallan>> hugging Wit
Later, Hoid acted as the carriage driver for [[Adolin\|Adolin]] when he is visiting [[Shallan\|Shallan]] at [[Shattered Plains\|Sebarial's warcamp]]. He speaks to [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] about his flute and mentions that he wants an interesting story from him. When [[Shallan\|Shallan]] recognizes him she happily hugs him for his advice from three and a half years prior when he encouraged her at her worst and told her to keep seeking the light.
Hoid, acting as Wit, visits [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] while he is in prison on Ishahach 1173, seven days into his imprisonment. He tells Kaladin the story of a man named Fleet who raced a highstorm across one end of [[Roshar\|Roshar]] to the other. Fleet wins, but dies of exhaustion at the end, and his spirit goes on to race the wind forever.

### The True Desolation
  Hoid, in his Wit persona
After the start of the True Desolation circa Ishishach 1173, on the day that the Everstorm was projected to hit [[Shinovar\|Shinovar]] on Jesesev 1174, he monologued to a Sleepless Hordling about the nature of art. After he finished his monologue, he met with [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]] as she exited the Cognitive Realm, offering to travel with her.

#### Siege of Kholinar
Hoid next appeared as Wit in Alethkar, discussing the nature of power with Shallan. Prior to that, while telling the story of Mishim in Alethkar, Hoid sees something next to his pack, which startles him. After the story, Shallan looks into Hoid's pack and sees a small, sealed black jar. The side of the jar pointing at Shallan was white. This might be a jar of sand from [[Taldain\|Taldain's]] Dayside, with the sand turning white showing Hoid a Surgebinder is near. This may be important, but not much is known about it. During Hoid's conversation with Shallan, he says that he knew of a group like the Cult of Moments, describing them as equally foolish and dangerous. It is unclear at the moment which group he may be referring to.
He later helps her get into the Cult of Moments, finding Shallan at her darkest moment, when she discovered the food she has been giving to the poor is just making things worse.
[[Shalash\|Shalash]], upon seeing sketches of [[Talenel\|Talenel]] and herself, wondered aloud why Midius, another name for Hoid, was giving away drawings of them.

#### Bonding of Design
Shortly after the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]] circa Nanishah 1174, Hoid was in [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] insulting a [[Thaylen\|Thaylen]] man in an attempt to elicit a reaction. Upon realizing that the man couldn't understand Alethi, Hoid decided that repeating it all in Thaylen would be boring, so he cut in front of the man. The man hit Hoid, knocking loose a tooth which Hoid discarded upon leaving the area. While in the city, he noticed Vatwha, recognizing her as an old acquaintance. Despite this old camaraderie, the Fused were trained to watch for him - most likely to capture him and deliver him to [[Odium\|Odium]].
While walking through the city he found a child around the corpse of her mother, and used [[Awakening\|Awakening]] to lure her away from the body, leaving her in the care of a family in the city. He then headed to the palace where he finds a [[Cryptic\|Cryptic]], the spren [[Elhokar\|Elhokar]] was about to bond before he died. This Spren was [[Design\|Design]], and he bonded to her, becoming a Surgebinder of the [[Order of Lightweavers\|Order of Lightweavers]].
During an unknown point in the year between his bonding of Design and the expedition in [[Emul\|Emul]] and Singer occupation of Urithiru, he and [[Jasnah\|Jasnah]] began a romantic relationship.

#### Campaign in Emul
He and Jasnah both went to the expedition in Emul in 1175. During their expedition, [[Ruthar\|Ruthar]] angered them both greatly, and Jasnah sent him to insult the highprince. After doing so, Ruthar challenged him to combat, but he chose Jasnah as his champion. She easily stabbed him through the throat, but had Renarin heal him.
He later noticed that a Sleepless was spying upon him and Jasnah.
When Kaladin was stuck in a vision by Odium, he and Design appeared to him in order to tell him the story of the Dog and the Dragon, in order to try and cheer him up and point him in the right direction.

#### Writing the Contract and the Ascension of Taravangian
He and Jasnah worked together in order to write up a contract for the contest of champions with Odium.
Some time after Taravangian took up Odium on Vevishev 1174, Hoid was visited by the new Vessel while he was telling stories at the Shattered Plains. Taravangian's demeanor revealed what happened to Hoid, who, terrified by the idea of Odium having a new Vessel, began to leave. Realizing that he was found out, Odium rammed into him with energy in order to lock him in place, trying to find a way to harm him without breaking the Shardic oath he was still held to. While searching, he discovered that Hoid kept his short-term memories stored in his Breaths. He destroyed these, erasing part of his memory, in order to redo the interaction. In this second interaction, Taravangian was able to interact with Hoid while successfully convincing the man that he was still Rayse. Hoid left this second conversation believing that everything had gone according to plan. However, afterwards he became aware of the fact that his memories were stolen and instituted protection protocols to defend himself if something or someone tried to interact with his soul.
The destruction of his Breaths led him to falling below the Second Heightening, and losing his Perfect Pitch.

#### Sigzil and the Dawnshard
>“*I was wrong. I did the best with the situation I had, hoping it would prevent calamity. I ruined your life, and I was wrong. I’m sorry.*”
\-Hoid to Sigzil[6]


At some point, Hoid asked his apprentice Sigzil to briefly take up the same Dawnshard that gave Hoid his immortality, an action that he believed would be necessary to avert calamity. Hoid passed the Dawnshard to Sigzil, who was changed in some ways that were similar to Hoid, acquiring the ability to Skip to any planet in the cosmere, as well as his own inability to do violence. This action would ultimately cause Sigzil to nearly kill his spren [[Auxiliary\|Auxiliary]] when the Dawnshard drew upon the Investiture that made up the spren in an attempt to defend itself. This action ruined Sigzil's life, and forced him to remain on the move outrunning the [[Night Brigade\|Night Brigade]] in their quest to capture him. Hoid regained possession of that Dawnshard again as well, meaning Sigzil was ultimately running from the Night Brigade to prevent them from finding Hoid. However, Hoid had come to feel sorrowful for his actions there, and felt like though his motivations were noble, the outcomes were ultimately not worth it and he was wrong to have done what he did.

#### The Letters
  With Frost
At some point, he wrote a letter to [[Frost\|Frost]]. He wrote about how he was being hunted by the Seventeenth Shard and has set a false trail for them to follow, referencing the three figures sent by the Seventeenth Shard that were searching for him. He came across as not at all worried about them, and in fact seemed mildly amused. He also asked Frost for his support in stopping Rayse, but was dismissed since Odium was trapped in the [[Rosharan system\|Rosharan system]].
He attempted to contact various Shards about Rayse and his worries that he would eventually escape. The figures he contacted were [[Endowment\|Endowment]], [[Autonomy\|Autonomy]], and [[Harmony\|Harmony]]. The first two responded with aggressive dismissal, but Harmony was very receptive to his contact and responded curiosity and a desire for further contact.
Due to him being more receptive towards his advances, he contacted Harmony again, and requested that he try to contact other Shards concerning the growing threat of Rayse's escape from the Rosharan System, a request he fulfilled. This contact resulted in a variety of different responses, which, as with his own attempts, resulted mostly in dismissal.

### Post-Catacendric Scadrial
>“*Oh, my lord, I know it, I do. I own the place, technically. Now, regarding those coins for old Hoid, my good lord...*”
\-Hoid to Wax[197]


In 342 [[Catacendre\|PC]], following his actions on Roshar, Hoid returned to Scadrial to attend the [[Yomen-Ostlin wedding dinner\|wedding]] of Lord [[Joshin Yomen\|Joshin Yomen]] and Lady [[Mi'chelle Ostlin\|Mi'chelle Ostlin]], two friends of his that he had made at some unknown point in the past. He did so via finding some way to bypass the strong Connection binding him to Roshar after becoming a Surgebinder
Rather than coming to Scadrial in response to some important event, Hoid initially came merely to congratulate his friends. He came dressed all in black, appearing as a scruffy looking beggar and spoke to the couple soon after they arrived at the dinner. It is unknown if he was present for the subsequent Vanisher attack. Hoid may have left the planet briefly afterwards, but something on Scadrial had caught his attention and he was back several months later. After [[Nicelle Sauvage\|Nicelle Sauvage]]’s encounter with [[Nazh\|Nazh]], Hoid bumped into her, and offered to tell her a story, which she ended up declining. Hoid also became employed as [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian's]] new carriage driver. By that point he had become friendly with Wayne, who liked him but did not know anything about Hoid's true identity. When Wax headed to the precinct station to question [[Rian\|Rian]], Hoid drove the carriage and Wayne rode up front with him. During the carriage ride, Hoid eavesdropped on Wax's conversation with [[Harmony\|Harmony]] about Bleeder's plans to disrupt the [[Elendel Basin\|Elendel Basin]].
Hoid's actions after this point are unclear. Hoid somehow obtained a coin-like [[/wiki/Feruchemy#Unsealed Metalminds]] containing a memory of [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] aiding the [[Southern Peoples of Scadrial\|southern Scadrians]] in surviving the aftereffects of the Catacendre. He also spent some time in [[New Seran\|New Seran]] and following [[Nazh\|Nazh's]] theft of [[Nicki Savage\|Nicki Savage's]] map of New Seran, Hoid asked her if she wanted to hear a story, an offer that she declined. He has also somehow come to the conclusion that he is the true owner of [[Kelesina Shores\|Kelesina Shores']] mansion there, for somewhat legitimate but unknown reasons. He was apparently a regular intruder on the mansion grounds, to the irritation of the guards. During this time, Hoid took the appearance of a beggar with long, unkempt fingernails and a ragged shirt. Hoid appeared blind with milky white eyes.
When Waxillium Ladrian walked up the path to Kelesina's mansion to attend a [[Kelesina Shores' party\|party]] with [[Steris Harms\|Steris Harms]], Hoid climbed out of the bushes, startling Wax, although Wax did not recognise Hoid as his carriage driver through his disguise. Wanting to reveal Kelsier's resurrection and identity as the Sovereign, Hoid looked for an opportunity to pass on the unsealed metalmind. He asked Wax for a few clips. Steris noticed Hoid's cologne and asked him if he was wearing cologne. Hoid was startled by her observation and claimed that he had been drinking perfume, as it had quite a kick. Steris told him that that was unhealthy and Wax advised Hoid that he should leave the private grounds. Hoid agreed but claimed that it was his property and again asked for coins. Wax gave him a banknote and told him again to leave the grounds. Hoid claimed it was far too much and that he wished to give Waxillium change. As Wax walked away, Hoid threw the coin at Wax's head, who caught it in midair. A groundsman then noticed Hoid and tried to chase him off. Hoid laughed and escaped back into the bushes again.

>“*Carriage for you, sir?*”
\-Hoid to Wax in the middle of the ocean[216]


Hoid later became involved in the sting operation that Marasi ran in [[Bilming\|Bilming]] in 348 [[Catacendre\|PC]]. He had a silent interaction with [[Wan ShaiLu\|Moonlight]] from different trucks. Moonlight commented that she couldn't tell whether she was watching Hoid or if Hoid was watching her, but then resolved that they were both just keeping an eye on the same third parties. After Wax arrived in Bilming, and gave chase to [[Dumad\|Dumad]] he casually appeared in a sleek black car to give Wax a ride. In Bilming, he traded his harmonica with Wayne for a rat named [[Sir Squeekins\|Sir Squeekins]]. Since this event, he has been taking good care of Sir Squeekins. He also showed up to rescue Wax from the ocean in a small boat after the explosion of the [[Pewternaut\|Pewternaut]] A16.


### Bet with the Sorceress of Lumar
Hoid would later go on to visit the planet of [[Lumar\|Lumar]], a relative backwater in the cosmere.
At some point he informed his friend, the [[Kandra\|kandra]] [[Ulaam\|Ulaam]], of his intentions to visit the planet via letter. Still hoping to gain access to AonDor, he met with [[Riina\|Riina]], who was living on the planet in the guise the Sorceress of the Midnight Sea. While visiting her island, Hoid agreed to a bet with her. Riina would be allowed to place him under a curse, and in exchange, if he could successfully break it, he would be granted admission to the Elantrians and the ability to use AonDor. The curse placed on him stripped him of his sense of humor, sense of style, sense of decorum, sense of purpose, intelligence, and sense of self. In order to break the curse, he would need to return to the central room of the Sorceress' ship on her island. As a part of the curse, he was also forbidden from telling anyone any information about his curse, how he had been given it, or how it could be broken. Riina finished her casting by sending Hoid far away from the Midnight Sea. During his time here, he likely came into possession of some Midnight spores.

>“*I once ate an entire watermelon in one sitting. And it gave me diarrhea.*”
\-Hoid to Tress while under the effects of Riina's curse[3]

While under the effects of this curse, Hoid's behavior bore little resemblance to his normal personality. He dressed quite oddly, trying at times to wear every shade of orange he could find, or his red-sequined briefs. He spent time doing things like inventing the card game Kings, in which you hold your cards backwards and can see everyone's hand but your own, an invention that lost him many of his possessions. Bad jokes and nonsensical ideas filled basically all his time, and he was only very rarely able to think clearly enough to communicate anything meaningful or work to accomplish his goals. He was left with some dim awareness of his situation though, a cruel decision on the part of Riina who wanted him aware enough to be horrified by his situation. Any attempt to share information about his curse would only start him stuttering and send him back to his normal befuddled state.
Hoid spent a long time at sea, wandering without apparent progress at breaking his curse. Ulaam eventually arrived on the planet and found Hoid, but was uninterested in working too hard to free him from his curse, preferring to simply stick close and wait for the problem to resolve itself. The two of them spent at least a year traveling together in this way. Eventually Hoid would become the cabin boy of the *[[Whistlebow\|Whistlebow]]*. He came into contact with [[Charlie\|Charlie]], son of the duke of [[Diggen's Point\|Diggen's Point]] and returned there to give [[Tress\|Tress]] a ceramic cup and Charlie's first letter to her.
Later, he was traded for by [[Fort\|Fort]] for a large sum on the orders of Captain [[Crow\|Crow]] who was interested in Hoid once she had heard that he had been cursed by the Sorceress. Hoid settled onto a routine onto the *[[Crow's Song\|Crow's Song]]*, working as a cabin boy there as well, and kept fed despite his near-uselessness by Fort. Ulaam continued as his companion, and the two were suffered by the crew despite their oddities, due in part to Ulaam's skill with medicine. During his time on the *Crow's Song*, Hoid gave midnight spores to [[Weev\|Weev]], the ship's [[Sprouter\|sprouter]], believing them to be licorice.
Another of his shipmates, Tress, became interested in Hoid's past after Ulaam explained to her that Hoid had been cursed, and approached him on the deck of the ship to try to obtain information about the Sorcess despite his curse. Hoid was unable to say much of note, but he dimly realized she was trying to help him and was able to offer some cryptic clues, asking Tress to bring him to her planet so he could save her, meaning the map of Lumar present on the Sorceress's ship. He also told her to look for a grouping of six stars, a carving under her bed, which would lead her to Weev's secret supply of midnight aether. After Tress recovered the midnight aether, Ulaam confronted Hoid, asking if he had given the aether to her. Ulaam and Tress continued to press Hoid for information and he was able to tell them to look for a person that is not a person and could talk when they should not, which they realized referred to Charlie in his guise of Huck the rat.

  Hoid's duel with the Sorceress.
As the *Crow's Song* continued its journey into the Crimson Sea, Hoid continued to stymie Tress's attempts to wheedle more information out of him, unable to point at words on a sheet of paper that might be relevant to his curse. However, Tress realized that he she could glean information from his silences though, as he stopped speaking when the subject turned to the matter of his curse. This allowed him to indicate to her where Riina's island might be found on a map. As they traveled closer to the [[Midnight Sea\|Midnight Sea]], Huck convinced the addled Hoid to dump much of the ship's food and water overboard, in an unsuccessful attempt to force the crew to return the to [[Emerald Sea\|Emerald Sea]].
Later when the *Crow's Song* reached the Sorceress's island, the ship's crew carried Hoid into the Sorceress's ship to save Tress and Huck, who had realized that bringing Hoid to the center of the Sorceress's power would break the curse, and hopefully allow him to defeat her. When Hoid entered the tower, the terms of the bet were fulfilled and he was restored to his sense and transformed into an Elantrian. Hoid arrived just in time to use AonDor to throw up a shield and prevent Riina from cursing Tress. In the brief confrontation that followed, Riina judged that she was not confident enough that she could defeat Hoid to risk a direct confrontation with him, instead choosing to flee the planet and let Hoid, Tress, and Charlie go free. While Hoid was unable to directly remove the curse on Charlie, he was able to tweak the parameters so that Charlie could break the curse himself once he returned to Diggen's Point with Tress. Hoid may have lingered with them for some time giving Charlie some pointers on storytelling and music.
Hoid would later share his adventure with Tress and Charlie as a story to an unknown audience, potentially made up of people from the planet [[First of the Sun\|First of the Sun]]. It is unknown exactly when he tells this story relative to the events, but it is known to be within years or decades, but less than centuries.

### Meeting with Sigzil on Canticle
When Hoid's apprentice Sigzil arrived on [[Canticle\|Canticle]], Sigzil's spren [[Auxiliary\|Auxiliary]] used some Investiture they had acquired to temporarily reinforce Sigzil's Connection to Hoid, allowing Hoid to appear before Sigzil as an illusion. Sigzil remained angry with Hoid for the betrayal, feeling as if he had been tricked and used by Wit when he was asked to take up the Dawnshard, and forced into his life of fleeing the Night Brigade. He confronted Hoid in anger for this and his betrayal in the warcamps. Hoid responded by explaining to Sigzil that he had taken him on as an apprentice due to his hunger for answers to all his questions. Hoid reminded Sigzil that while that it was a good instinct, it's important to realize that the questions are more important than the answers themselves sometimes. As the Connection faded, Hoid apologized sincerely to Sigzil for his mistake, and for ruining his life.

### Frozen on Komashi

At some point after Sigzil's overthrowing of the [[Cinder King\|Cinder King]], Hoid went with [[Design\|Design]] to [[Komashi\|Komashi]] and was almost instantly frozen in place, unable to move. This was due to the protection measures that he instituted to prevent other entities from interfering with his Investiture after recovering from [[Odium\|Odium's]] destruction of his breaths. It activated as, immediately upon his arrival, the [[Father machine\|father machine]] attempted to absorb his Investiture to power itself. Seeing his state, Design spraypainted him copper and used him as a coatrack in her new noodle shop, the [[Noodle Pupil\|Noodle Pupil]]. At some point following his stasis, he formed a Connection with [[Nikaro\|Painter]], [[Yumi\|Yumi]], and [[Liyun\|Liyun]] allowing him to tell what they were doing, feeling, and thinking, along with many others on the planet, though he felt it with them particularly acutely, and knew it had something to do with him.
After the father machine was destroyed by Yumi, and the attempts to absorb his Investiture thus halted, he was freed from his stasis. He planned with Design to disguise themselves as astronauts and steal a ship, allowing them to travel to the nearby [[Iron Seven Waystation\|Iron Seven Waystation]].
He kept in contact with Nikaro, Yumi, and Masaka, via letters and inquiries, allowing him to keep up with their lives and how society coped with the loss of the [[Shroud\|shroud]]. He would eventually tell the story of [[Yumi\|Yumi]] and [[Nikaro\|Painter]] to an unknown audience on Roshar, with permission from those involved.
It is possible that Hoid had been to Komashi at some point before the activation of the father machine, as he had some implied familiarity with some elements of [[Torio\|Torish]] culture.

## Relationships
Due to his nature as a worldhopper, Hoid has met most of the main characters in the cosmere, as well as a large quantity of side characters.

### The Shards
Hoid's relationships with the various [[Vessel\|Vessels]] are varied, to say the least, ranging from hate and terror to respect and cameraderie.

\-Ulaam to Tress on Hoid[226]



### Roshar
In his position as King's, and later, Queen's Wit, Hoid has had opportunities to interact with many notable Rosharans, and has taken full advantage of such chances.

## Speculation
### Worldsingers & Worldbringers
The names of the [[Worldsingers\|Worldsingers]], a group of storytellers on Roshar, and the Conclave of [[Worldbringers\|Worldbringers]], the leading body of the original [[Terris\|Terris]] religion, are strikingly similar. Brandon has stated that this is not a coincidence. Some believe that Hoid is a common root to both of these organizations, one of which, the Worldbringers, was very [[Realmatic Theory\|Realmatically]] aware. In addition to this he is known to be a founder of the Worldsingers and a member of the Worldbringers.
