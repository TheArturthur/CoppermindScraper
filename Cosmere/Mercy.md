**Mercy** is a [[Shard\|Shard]] of [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]] that has not been Splintered and whose Vessel is unknown.

## History
Mercy was created at the [[Shattering of Adonalsium\|Shattering of Adonalsium]] and picked up by an unknown Vessel. It is not known what Mercy did directly after their Ascension, or where they settled, if they settled at all.
Mercy was involved in a battle between [[Odium\|Odium]] and [[Ambition\|Ambition]], which resulted in a wound upon the [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual Realm]] and ultimately in Ambition's Splintering. This clash had profound effects on [[Threnody\|Threnody]].
Some time around the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], [[Harmony\|Harmony]] reached out to Mercy about the threat posed by Odium, at [[Hoid\|Hoid's]] request, but became troubled by Mercy as a result of their exchange.

## Trivia
Before [[Aona\|Aona's]] Shard was known (and well before it was known that Mercy is a Shard), fans speculated that its Intent might be Mercy. It was later revealed Aona's Shard is Devotion.
