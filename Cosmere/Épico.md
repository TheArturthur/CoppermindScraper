The **Epics** are a group of magical beings on . They start appearing around the same time as the satellite . Every Epic has a weakness that invalidates their powers. When Epics gain their powers, they go through a period called the Rending, where they feel an overwhelming urge to destroy. When Epics die, mitochondrial mutation occurs in their bodies. When an Epic uses their powers, it corrupts them and turns them evil unless they can overcome their greatest fear. The source of an Epic's power is their DNA.

## High Epics
High Epics are Epics that have a prime invincibility. A prime invincibility is a power that makes conventional assassination methods useless. Some examples are regeneration, impervious skin, precognition, and self-reincarnation.

### Known High Epics


























## Lesser Epics
Any Epic who does not have Prime Invincibility is considered a Lesser Epic, although the term is not used in the books.

### Known Lesser Epics






















## Epics of Unknown Status



































## Types of Epic


Photon-manipulators create actual changes in the way light behaves, crafting illusions with photons. They are similar to electricity-manipulation Epics.
Mental illusionists affect the brains of other people around them. They create hallucinations, not true illusions. They are similar to other mentalists.

Hypnotists
Mind-Control

Dimensionalist Epics commonly possess the power of Essokinesis, or the ability to manipulate reality. The amount of power given by their Essokinesis differs, sometimes being only able to create realistic illusions, while more powerful Dimensionalists can make their alternate realities real in their own world, an example being [[Megan Tarash\|Megan]] creating rock slides after merging a reality where a rock slide happened into her own world. Their powers, while they may seem very similar to Illusionists', actually summon "shadows" from another reality, which then manifest into the Dimensionalist's world. More powerful Dimensionalists can also summon tears in reality. Walking through one of these rifts temporarily transports you to another dimension.

Transference Epics can give others their powers. These Epics are also known as Gifters. Gifter Epics are able to give a portion of their powers to people within a certain range of them and for a limited time. The power they give away is not affected by their weakness. While gifting powers to others, Gifter Epics lose some of the corruption and desire to do evil that is associated with Epics. The more power that an epic is gifting (the more people being gifted to), the greater the reduction in evil intent. Gifters cannot give their powers to another Epic.


Standard fire Epics can turn to flame, fly, throw fire, and manipulate existing flames.

Standard animator Epics can control inanimate objects with their mind. It is unknown if the objects in question have to be in human shape.

Linguistic Epics can manipulate language, through making others speak in rhymes, or speaking any language, among others. The majority of them are lesser Epics.
### Power Duality
Power duality is when an Epic has two second-tier abilities that meld into a first-tier one. An example of this would be the Epic Faultline. Faultline actually had two separate abilities regarding shifting earth, but combined both of them to have the power to make the ground loose, push objects into it, and re-solidify the ground.

## Epic Weaknesses
An Epic's Weakness can be just about anything. Some epics, upon seeing a specific pattern or symbol, lose their powers for a few moments. Some become weak when they think certain thoughts, stop eating certain foods, or eating the wrong food. Specific numbers can make an Epic weak as well. The weaknesses are tied to the person's history and is actually their greatest fear. If the Epic can overcome that fear, the insanity caused by 's influence is dissipated, allowing them to keep the powers but also their original, untainted personality.
