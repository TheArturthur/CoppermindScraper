**Monrome** is the native planet of the [[Dione\|diones]].
Diones are the only sapient species known to inhabit Monrome. It presumably has some bodies of water, as the aquatic [[Garqua\|garqua]] is native to the planet. There are no predators; all of the known fauna are scavengers and herbivores. When the diones colonize a new planet, they usually eliminate the local wildlife and import specimens from Monrome as replacements. Given the prominent position of diones in the [[Superiority\|Superiority]], some species from Monrome have become quite widely distributed.
