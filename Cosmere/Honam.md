**Honam** is one of the [[Torish\|Torish]] scholars from the [[Institute of Mechanical Solutions\|Institute of Mechanical Solutions]] who is involved in the creation of the [[Father machine\|father machine]] and who is later sent by the machine to prevent [[Yumi\|Yumi]] from escaping her prison.

## Appearance and Personality
Like other Torish scholars, he has a bearded chin and mustache. He wears white clothing with a black, winged .
Honam is relatively laid back and listless compared to his colleagues.

## History
Prior to his death, Honam worked with other scholars to develop and activate the father machine. His soul was kept in reserve by the machine upon its activation, for the purpose of its self-defense, though he was still turned into a [[Nightmare\|nightmare]]. When Yumi's mind became resistant to the machine's tampering, Honam was one of the four scholars sent to [[Gongsha Town\|Gongsha Town]] to investigate, under the leadership of [[Gyundok\|Gyundok]].
Their prototype machine did not work upon arrival, which [[Sunjun\|Sunjun]] determined to be an issue with their power source. When Gyundok complained that they never had this problem before, Honam--lounging in pillows and eating a piece of fruit--argued that they have. Honam suggested waiting for Yumi to summon a [[Hijo\|spirit]], but Sunjun responded that she was unlikely to do this anytime soon. Gyundok ordered Honam to prime the machine with his own essence, but Honam refused and ultimately the [[Fourth Torish scholar\|fourth Torish scholar]] offered to do so.
When Nikaro and Yumi approached the scholars to destroy the prototype machine, Honam came out of their tent and handed the other scholars special goggles that enabled them to see Yumi.
Honam remained with the others after Yumi and [[Nikaro\|Nikaro]] were separated, working to resolve the issues in Gongsha Town and contain Yumi. When Yumi escaped, he chased her with the other scholars to [[Torio City\|Torio City]], where Yumi's dominating will forced him to stand down.
