**Weswara** is the homeland of the **Weswarans**. It is on the island equivalent to Britain, along with the [[Waelish\|Waelish]] kingdom of the [[Black Bear\|Black Bear]]. [[Hordaland\|Hordaland]] lies to the east, across the ocean.
Weswara is threatened from both directions, between the Black Bear's kingdom and the Hordamen from the sea. Life there is generally harsh, and people are focused on the needs of survival.
Weswara is governed by thegns (who oversee a village), reeves (an intermediate authority), and earls (controlling large areas). The title of [[Bretwalda\|bretwalda]] is roughly equivalent to king, but it appears to be currently vacant.
Weswara is fairly thinly populated. The earldom centered at [[Maelport\|Maelport]] includes ten villages as well as the city, and is about a five-day walk - perhaps a hundred miles - across.
Settlements in Weswara include [[Stenford\|Stenford]], [[Wellbury\|Wellbury]], and [[Maelport\|Maelport]].
