**Oswald** is [[Ealstan\|Ealstan's]] nephew and a guard in [[Stenford\|Stenford]]. He is a very good-natured, cheerful, and respectful young man.
Oswald manned a wooden watchtower in [[Stenford\|Stenford]] and came down to close the gate after [[Ulric Stromfin\|Ulric Stromfin]] and [[Quinn Jericho\|Quinn Jericho]] arrived. He then took an axe and shield and went to guard the door to the manor. He was killed when Ulric shot him with a modern gun in order to prove to Ealstan that he could kill whomever he chose. [[Rowena\|Rowena]] arranged for Oswald's burial and spoke with his mother and with [[Hairud\|Hairud]] to tell them of his passing and of his heroism.
