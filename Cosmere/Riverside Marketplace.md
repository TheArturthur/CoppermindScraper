**Riverside Marketplace** is a market area right by the river in the town where [[Holly Winseed (Original)\|Holly]] lives. Its theming shows it as being open air, but it is actually enclosed by a high clear dome. The produce there is fresh, and there is a citrus stand there run by [[Stilla\|Stilla]]. There are artists selling hand-loomed fabrics there, as well as other crafts. Its  shows a quaint, old school market. Without theming, it is actually just a bunch of white stalls and buildings, with some slight texturing on the walls that give the impression of stucco.
Holly Winseed and Jonathan first meet at the Riverside Marketplace at Stilla’s citrus stand, and they frequent the marketplace often. [[Holly Winseed (Provisional Replica)\|Holly's Provisional Replica]] goes there to search for her original, and an [[ICON\|ICON]] fire team lays an ambush there and kidnaps her.
