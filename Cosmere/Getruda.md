## Appearance and Personality
Getruda is a short woman who often wears a bowler hat. She has a remarkable obsession with Wayne and attempts to imitate him, although according to Wayne her accent is all over the place. While she claims to have understood him, it is just a superficial thing; for example, she believes him to enjoy feeling pain, and she tries to brute-force liking it as well mid-fight. When asked about this obsession by Wax, she said that for certain people the chance to become someone else is appealing.

## Attributes and Abilities
Getruda is a Slider and a Bloodmaker with large quantities of health stored in her metalmind. Her abilities are the result of [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgy]] and not natural; it is unknown whether or not she has other spikes in her body. She is remarkably skilled with dueling canes, more than [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]] and [[Wayne\|Wayne]].

## History
Getruda is introduced in The Lost Metal as a direct antagonist to Wayne. She is partnered with Dumad, who plays the same antagonistic, mirror role with Wax. She is first seen during the Bilming Raid when she barges into a speed bubble Wayne had set up so that he and Marasi could confer and plan in the midst of the battle. This is the first time one of Wayne's speed bubbles is infringed upon, and it disturbs both him and Marasi.
Throughout The Lost Metal she antagonizes and annoys Wayne, trying to mimic not only his abilities, but also his personality.
