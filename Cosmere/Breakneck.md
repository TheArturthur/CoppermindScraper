**Breakneck** is a game played by the [[Vorin\|Vorin]] peoples of [[Roshar\|Roshar]] during the [[Era of Solitude\|Era of Solitude]] and [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]]. It is played fairly widely, both in gambling dens and among common [[Darkeyes\|darkeyes]].

## Rules
Breakneck is played with stones and involves throws, tosses, and draws. Although it is a betting game, players do not directly wager on the aspects of the game that involve random chance. Instead, due to the Vorin fear of predicting the future, they bet on the hand that they hold after all the throws and draws.
There are three known types of throws in breakneck. The first is known as the **tower** and is made up of three pairs; this is an outright loss. The **queen**, composed of two trios, results in an outright win. The final known throw is the **butcher**, which is made of a trio and a pair and could either win or lose, depending on your other throws and the throws of the other players.
