>“*Ashertmarn, the Heart of the Revel, is the final of the three great Mindless Unmade. His gift to men is not prophecy or battle focus, but a lust for indulgence.*”
\-From Hessi's Mythica, page 224[1]

## Appearance and Abilities
Ashertmarn takes the form of a giant, black, inhuman heart that beats to an irregular rhythm. Thick black veins sprout from the heart, melding with the ground nearby.
He leads people to indulge in excess. He speaks to the people in his area, urging them to abandon their lives and responsibilities. The closer one is to him, the harder it is to resist Ashertmarn's tempting plea.

## History
  Facing off with <<Shallan\|Veil>> in <<Kholinar\|Kholinar>>
For more images, see [[Ashertmarn/Gallery\|/Gallery]].
Ashertmarn awakened/arrived in [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] when the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]] first passed over the city.
During the mission to aid Kholinar, [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] discovered the presence of two [[Unmade\|Unmade]], including Ashertmarn. In order to investigate the revel, Shallan created a reputation by delivering food to the poor. Once she had been heard of, she took a large offering of food to the revel and was accepted onto the [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]], Ashertmarn's location. The Oathgate was divided into three sections. In the outer section, the people delighted in an abundance of delicious foods, mindlessly sating their hunger for the revel. In the next ring inward, the occupants crawled from place to place, too focused on the excess to even stand. The food there was rotten and moldy, infested with [[Decayspren\|decayspren]]. In the center ring was the Unmade himself, completely covering the Oathgate's control building. Shallan would not have been able to extract herself from the revel if not for [[Sja-anat\|Sja-anat's]] interruption, who appeared to Shallan, breaking her focus on the black heart.
Later, when Shallan had to clear the Oathgate platform as an escape route for the people of Kholinar, she tried to banish it the same way she did with [[Re-Shephir\|Re-Shephir]]. After trying to convince Shallan to indulge mindlessly, Ashertmarn retreated for reasons unknown. It's possible he did so so that the Oathgate, whose spren had been corrupted by Sja-anat, could kill Shallan, [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]], [[Adolin\|Adolin]], and [[Azure\|Azure]].

## Trivia
The names of all [[Unmade\|Unmade]] are derived from real-life mythology; however, in Ashertmarn's case, the original source is unclear. It could be derived from Sumerian sea goddess .
