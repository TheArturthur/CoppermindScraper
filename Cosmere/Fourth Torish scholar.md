This article's title is uncanonical and a fan created one, because an official term or name has not been made yet.
The **fourth Torish scholar** is one of the [[Torish\|Torish]] scholars from the [[Institute of Mechanical Solutions\|Institute of Mechanical Solutions]] who is involved in the creation of the [[Father machine\|father machine]] and who is later sent by the machine to prevent [[Yumi\|Yumi]] from escaping her prison.

## Appearance and Personality
Like other Torish scholars, he has a bearded chin and mustache, though his mustache is not as impressive as the others'. He wears white clothing with a black, winged .
He is relatively quiet and withdrawn compared to his colleagues.

## History
Prior to his death, he worked with other scholars to develop and activate the father machine. His soul was kept in reserve by the machine upon its activation, for the purpose of its self-defense, though he was still turned into a [[Nightmare\|nightmare]]. When Yumi's mind became resistant to the machine's tampering, he was one of the four scholars sent to [[Gongsha Town\|Gongsha Town]] to investigate, under the leadership of [[Gyundok\|Gyundok]].
Their prototype machine did not work upon arrival, which [[Sunjun\|Sunjun]] determined to be an issue with their power source. After the other scholars refused to use their own essence to prime the machine, the fourth scholar emerged from the shadows of the tent and volunteered. He began to charge the machine, though as Yumi drew near to see what he was doing she unwittingly assisted him in priming it, leaving him relieved to be okay.
The fourth scholar remained with the others after Yumi and [[Nikaro\|Nikaro]] were separated, working to resolve the issues in Gongsha Town and contain Yumi. When Yumi escaped, he chased her with the others to [[Torio City\|Torio City]], where Yumi's dominating will forced him to stand down.
