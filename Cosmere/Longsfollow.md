**Longsfollow** is a village along a canal in the [[Southern Dominance\|Southern Dominance]] in the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]]. It serves as a rest stop for canalmasters and their [[Skaa\|skaa]] workers, and as a hub for commerce. Noblemen who own plantations come there to trade, and ship their goods to [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]]. Because of all this trade, Longsfollow is a busy civic center.
The village is distinguished by the presence of two crumbling towers across the canal from the main body of the village. 
[[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] lives there with his wife [[Mare\|Mare]] before their raid on [[Kredik Shaw\|Kredik Shaw]] that sent both of them to the [[Pits of Hathsin\|Pits of Hathsin]]. They have to quickly abandon their dwelling there when Kelsier kills seven nobles to avenge the death of a skaa servant girl, who had been executed for spilling tea.
