The **Reod** was an event that occurred on [[Sel\|Sel]] about ten years prior to the [[Fjordell\|Fjordell]] [[Invasion of Arelon\|invasion of Arelon]]. The word Reod is based on Aon Reo which means punishment.
The Reod was a massive earthquake that created an enormous [[Chasm\|chasm]] in the south of [[Arelon\|Arelon]]. It altered the landscape to the point where the [[Aon\|Aons]] used by [[Elantrian\|Elantrians]], which are based upon the landscape of Arelon, were no longer accurate. This caused all Aons to cease functioning, including the massive Aon Rao created by the city of Elantris and its surrounding cities, preventing the Elantrians from accessing [[Investiture\|Investiture]], and afflicting them with an incomplete Shaod transformation. It was seen by [[Shu-Keseg\|Shu-Keseg]] and [[Shu-Dereth\|Shu-Dereth]] as a curse upon the Elantrians for their pagan ways.
After the fall of Elantris, there were violent attacks on the weakened Elantrians and almost all the high-ranking people who had anything to do with them. This resulted in a monarchy under the rule of Iadon. Yet people continued to be taken by the shaod. Those stricken with the Shaod were treated as dead (complete with burial wrappings and a funeral offering of food) and exiled to Elantris, where they would accumulate eternally painful injuries until they succumbed to the pain. The city itself rapidly deteriorierted without the energy of the Dor.
[[Raoden\|Raoden]] is able to reverse or cure the Reod by adding "the chasm line" to the Aon Rao of Elantris, which allowed the [[Dor\|Dor]] to flow properly again through the Aons, restoring the Elantrians and the Aons to their former glory.
The earthquake was not natural.
