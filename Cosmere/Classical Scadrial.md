## Geography and Ecology
>“
\-The great mountains to the north  with their bald snowcaps and forested mantles  stand like watchful gods over this land of green fertility. My own lands to the south are mostly flat; I think that they might look less dreary if there were a few mountains to vary the terrain.


Classical Scadrial was extremely Earth-like, with a blue sky and a yellow sun. This ended with the Lord Ruler's ascension, which marked the end of the Classical age of Scadrial.
During this time Scadrial also had many of the same animals and plants as our own earth, including horses, flowers and dogs. The deepness, which arrived at the end of the era, and the Lord Ruler’s ascension destroyed many species.

### Notable Landmarks
[[Khlennium\|Khlennium]] - A large city located somewhere in the middle of the northern continent, the lands around it were mostly flat.
[[Terris\|Terris]] hills - A large mountain range in the North, it is home to the [[Terris\|Terris]] people.
[[Darrelnai\|Darrelnai]] - A city or kingdom located on the northern continent. It survived the deepness and was eventually conquered by the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]].
The [[Southern Islands\|Southern Islands]] - A large collection of Islands in the south of what would later become the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]]. These islands were home to many volcanoes.
## Culture and Societies
### Forms of Government
Many nations during this time were ruled by monarchs, both kings and queens. Examples of nations ruled by monarchs are [[Khlennium\|Khlennium]] and ‘The fiery empire of the West’. Not all nations were ruled by monarchs however, The Terris for example were not ruled by a monarch, although their form of government is unknown.

### Prophecy of the Hero of Ages
The various classical civilisations believed in a number of [[Terris Prophecies\|prophecies]]. These prophecies were about a Hero, called The Hero of Ages, who would one day save the world. The civilisations all had a different name for this Hero, with the Khlenni calling him Rabzeen, but the prophecies were the same.

### The Metallic Arts

During this time period, [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]] was almost entirely unheard of. Towards the end of the era, when the [[Deepness\|Deepness]] arrived, it began to snap people into Mistings; Mistborn did not appear until Rashek discovered and gave away the [[Lerasium\|lerasium]] located at the [[Well of Ascension\|Well of Ascension]].


[[Feruchemy\|Feruchemy]] was the most wide-spread of the [[Metallic Arts\|Metallic Arts]], and even that remained isolated with the [[Terris\|Terris]] people. The Terris used Feruchemy for many things in their daily lives, from storing and tapping heat to pass through mountain passes to storing memories in their copperminds. [[Worldbringer\|Worldbringers]] in particular were known for using Feruchemy to record lore.


[[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgy]] was unknown to most, although piercings were seen as a means of communicating with a deity. For this reason the Hero of Ages wore Hemalurgically-charged piercings. This was a result of [[Ruin\|Ruin]] manipulating the [[Terris Prophecies\|Terris Prophecies]].

### Technology
The general level of technology at the end of this era was more advanced than that of the Final Empire. Before [[Rashek\|Rashek's]] Ascension, the people of Classical Scadrial had achieved steam technology, and were close to achieving locomotive technology.

### Civilizations
Known civilizations during this period include:


Ancient [[Terris\|Terris]]
The [[Astalsi\|Astalsi]]
The [[Khlenni\|Khlenni]]
The [[Urtan\|Urtan]]

## History
For more information, see [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
The classical age of [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]] began with the planet’s creation by the [[Shards\|Shards]] [[Preservation\|Preservation]] and [[Ruin\|Ruin]]. These Shards settled in the [[Scadrian System\|Scadrian System]] and created Scadrial together. During this process they not only created the planet, they also created life, including humans.
Thousands of years later a young man called [[Alendi\|Alendi]] was forced to flee his village due to unknown reasons. It is likely that this was exactly sixteen years before the Well of Ascension was refilled. He ended up in [[Khlennium\|Khlennium]], seeking a life of indistinction. Once there he met [[Kwaan\|Kwaan]], a [[Terris\|Terris]] worldbringer. Kwaan employed him as an assistant during his first months in the city. Years later Kwaan connected all of the signs of the Anticipation to Alendi, and announced his discovery to the other Worldbringers, they didn’t believe him however. So Kwaan became determined to convince them, insisting on traveling with Alendi to witness his journeys. After a while even the other Worldbringers became convinced that Alendi must be the Hero of Ages, as Alendi fueled these rumors to persuade the world of his cause, and Ruin slightly altered the prophecies to fit Alendi.
It was around this time that the deepness arrived, providing a threat that drove men to desperation both in action and belief. The deepness began ravaging the land, killing plants and animals alike.
At some point in time Alendi became king of Khlennium, possibly by marrying the previous king's daughter. Under the growing threat of the Deepness, Alendi united several nations (including Terris), some by diplomacy, and others by conquering them. Except for a few dissenters, Alendi was able to create a general unity on Scadrial under reign of Khlennium.
During his encounters with the Deepness, he Snapped and his Allomantic powers were awakened. He believed that he had sensed the Deepness' mind, and noted that it was not hateful, but would destroy the world as part of its nature. After Alendi spent a decade leading armies, the Terris Worldbringers decided that Alendi, the assumed Hero of Ages, should set forth to the Well of Ascension and give up its power in the name of the greater good. However, Kwaan realised that some being deceived them all by altering the prophecies, but he couldn't convince Alendi and the other Worldbringers that the power at the Well should not be released. Soon Alendi departed towards the Well of Ascension, giving no heed to Kwaan's warning since Alendi surrounded himself with other counselors who told him what he wanted to hear.
Upon arriving in Terris, Alendi replaced his normal attendants with Terris packmen who could carry his gear in the cold unforgiving mountains. They were a group of [[Feruchemy\|Feruchemists]] led by [[Rashek\|Rashek]]. Alendi started keeping a [[Alendi's logbook\|logbook]], in which he recorded his quest for the Well, describing hearing pulses coming from the Well due to his abilities as a [[Seeker\|Seeker]]. In this journal he also expressed regrets about the death and fear he has caused , doubts about his own sanity, but also his fear of the Deepness , and his faith that it needed to be defeated .
Unbeknownst to Alendi, Kwaan had instructed Rashek to do everything in his power to keep Alendi away from the Well of Ascension, and if necessary even to kill Alendi to prevent him from giving up the Well's power. Since the pulses coming from the Well drew Alendi closer with each beat, Rashek could not lead him astray and was forced to kill the King of Khlennium shortly before arriving at their destination.
