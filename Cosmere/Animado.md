## Abilities
They are extremely strong and relatively fire resistant. They can manipulate the mass of their bodies, regenerating limbs. This does cause them to shrink in size.

## Creation
Alivened are created by Dark Oculators who give up some of their humanity and invest (note that this book is non-cosmere and has nothing to do with ) it in , which is then put into the object to be Alivened. This removes some of the good human qualities from the Dark Oculator, but the Alivened object does not retain these good qualities -- they are twisted and evil instead.The power of the Alivened is determined by how emotionally dense the material it is made out of is for example, Codexians are made out of bad romance novels because they can soak up emotion, making them especially powerful.

## Cyborg
Members of the sect of librarians called the Scrivener's Bones have a penchant for replacing some of their body parts with alivened parts. A notable example of this is [[Kilimanjaro\|Kilimanjaro]], who replaced a full half of his body with alivened metal. This sect sees not only the stronger material as an advantage, but the removal of humanity as well.
