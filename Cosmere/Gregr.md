It is possible that he moved in after the death of  in a mining accident, but the specific timeline is unclear.
Wayne felt that Gregr did not care about him or [[Wayne's mother\|his mother]], and implied that Gregr was abusive. Gregr died in a mining accident at some point before 319 [[Catacendre\|PC]], being crushed by a number of rocks. After Gregr's death, Wayne sometimes kicked a table that Gregr had built for the nearly unfurnished home, hoping to spite him in case he was watching from the afterlife.
