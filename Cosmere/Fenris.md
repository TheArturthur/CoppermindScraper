**Fenris** is a monstrous wolf who is an enemy to the gods of the [[Weswarans\|Weswarans]]. [[Sefawynn\|Sefawynn]] calls him "that wolf which would consume the world", and says that he "brought with him the implements of metodgodas, the end of gods".

## History
He was bound by the warrior god [[Tiw\|Tiw]], and took Tiw's hand and tasted his blood. The [[Black Bear\|Black Bear]] freed him from his binding but forced him to obey the Bear. At the [[Battle of Badon\|battle of Badon]], a major battle between the Weswarans and the [[Waelish\|Waelish]] in the time of [[Ealstan\|Ealstan's]] grandfather, Fenris killed [[Friag\|Friag]] but was bound again with her dying breath. Fenris is now bound to the hill of the Black Bear. According to fate, it should have been Tiw who was killed instead.

## Speculation
As the wolf Fenrir in real-world Norse mythology is the son of Loki, and [[Logna\|Logna]] is called "mother of monsters" and seems to be the Weswaran equivalent of Loki, Fenris is likely the son of Logna.
