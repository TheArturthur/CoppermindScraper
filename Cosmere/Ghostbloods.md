The **Ghostbloods** are a secret organization found on many planets in the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]], formed for the purposes of protecting [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]] from all threats.
Members are required to get a tattoo of three overlapping diamonds somewhere on their bodies. The symbol bears a resemblance to the three-petal shape of [[Marewill flowers\|Marewill flowers]].

## Tenets
The Ghostbloods have three general tenets:

Protecting Scadrial.
Sharing what they know with each other, but not with outsiders.
Trusting each other.
## Objectives
### Scadrian Ghostbloods
The Scadrian Ghostbloods are devoted to protecting Scadrial at any cost, and due to this came into conflict with the [[Set\|Set]] and [[Autonomy\|Autonomy]].

### Rosharan Ghostbloods
>“*Power, portable, easily contained, renewable. You hold the energy of a storm in your hand, Veil. That raw energy, plucked from the heart of the raging tempest. It is tamed—not only a safe source of light, but of power that those with … particular interests and abilities can access.*”
\-Mraize to Shallan[9]

The Rosharan Ghostbloods seek power. They are seeking a way to get [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]] ([[Investiture\|Investiture]]) offworld from [[Roshar\|Roshar]] through [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]]. They hunt [[Restares\|Restares]] and the [[Sons of Honor\|Sons of Honor]] as they fear they are close to discovering the secret of making this possible. Stormlight is free, portable, easy-to-access power. To attain this goal, they need control of the [[Oathgate\|Oathgates]], which inspired their hunt for [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]]. They seek [[Perfect gemstone\|perfect gemstones]] that would allow the Stormlight to last long enough to get offworld, though there is a [[Connection\|Connection]] problem.
The Ghostbloods are obsessed with finding [[Ba-Ado-Mishram\|Ba-Ado-Mishram]], who has the ability to bind minds of an entire people, though their reasons are unclear. They are not interested in seeing [[Odium\|Odium]] rule Roshar. They seek to bond [[Sja-anat\|Sja-anat]], as her ancient knowledge would be invaluable.
They also seek to imprison [[Herald\|Heralds]] in gemstones, in order to obtain information. [[Thaidakar\|Thaidakar]] seeks knowledge about an affliction he shares with the Heralds, in order to save himself.
Their desire to find a way to carry Stormlight off-world, and to help Thaidakar learn how to leave Scadrial, likely ties into the Ghostblood's goal of protecting Scadrial. The Scadrian Ghostbloods, however, seem to see them as running amok.

## Resources
The Ghostbloods own a tenement building in [[Highprince\|Highprince]] [[Sebarial\|Sebarial's]] warcamp on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] that has a basement. In it there was a display of trophies that [[Shallan\|Shallan]] saw, including several enormous [[Gemheart\|gemhearts]], a tusk was probably from a [[Whitespine\|whitespine]], an eye socket that looked like the structure of a [[Santhid\|santhid]]’s skull, a vial of pale [[Sand (Taldain)\|sand]], a couple of thick hairpins, a lock of golden hair, a [[Yolen\|Yolish]] branch of a tree with writing on it, a silver knife, an odd flower preserved in some kind of solution, and a chunk of pale [[Aether\|pink crystal]] that looked like it might be some kind of gemstone. There were also shells that Shallan vaguely recognized. There were no plaques describing any of these mementos.
On Scadrial, they have a safehouse at house one eighty-seven, near Thirty-Third and Finete in the Knightbridge district of [[Bilming\|Bilming]]. It is protected with Identity locks and contains maps, a [[Seon\|seon]], an armory, and three jars of purified [[Dor\|Dor]] in a safe with an [[Awakening\|Awakened]] lock. They also own a large estate in [[Elendel\|Elendel]].

## Structure
The Ghostbloods operate across multiple planets within the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]]. They operate within a strict hierarchy, as a group of hunters without structure would turn on each other too easily. They do not strike against their own. They do not negotiate upward. It is common for a master to spy on their pupils. [[Ialai Sadeas\|Ialai Sadeas]] warns [[Shallan\|Shallan]] that the Ghostbloods will watch her to ensure she doesn't rise high enough to learn secrets that could hurt them.
Joining the Ghostbloods requires being brought in by a member of the organization, and the swearing of oaths to the Ghostbloods. It is tradition for the one who offers membership to become the mentor of the one they invited.
Upon joining the Ghostbloods, they share everything they know and the member can influence decisions. The Ghostbloods do not keep secrets from fellow members, but in most cases members are also not allowed to share Ghostblood secrets with non-members. Mraize warned Shallan that if she were to break ties with the group, she would be hunted. He and his babsk would not hunt her, but all they could do was discourage others. Members are not to share secret information with anyone outside of the organization, doing so would result in the assassination of the offender, due to the danger it can pose to the organization.
[[Thaidakar\|Thaidakar]] is not on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] and only comes as what they consider an avatar; he does show up directly to the Scadrian Ghostbloods. Thaidakar does affect the Rosharan Ghostbloods' actions, but they are a little removed from him on Roshar.

## History
### Formation
The Ghostbloods were formed on Scadrial at some point between the Scadrian year 1 [[Catacendre\|PC]] and the Vorin year 1168.

### Attempted Murder of Jasnah Kholin
The Ghostbloods have made several attempts to murder Jasnah Kholin, and claims that she has had a number of their members assassinated as well. When Jasnah spent time in [[Kharbranth\|Kharbranth]] to study the Voidbringers, a Ghostblood agent named [[Kabsal\|Kabsal]] infiltrated the local Ardentia in order to kill Jasnah. He used her young ward [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] to get close to Jasnah, which led to them forming a relationship. As Kabsal attempted to poison Jasnah with bread, he was inadvertently killed when he ate some of the poisoned bread and Jasnah Soulcast his antidote, mistakenly believing that to be the poison. Jasnah later found the Ghostblood tattoo on Kabsal's arm.
When Jasnah left Kharbranth, the Ghostbloods planted at least [[New kid\|one operative]] aboard the ship *[[Wind's Pleasure\|Wind's Pleasure]]* on the journey from [[Kharbranth\|Kharbranth]] to the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]]. That operative, along with other men [[Shallan\|Shallan]] did not recognize, attempted to murder Jasnah. They thought they'd succeeded, but in reality, Jasnah had escaped to [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]] by [[/wiki/Surge#Transportation]].
Jasnah assumes that she was targeted because of her Radiant oaths.

### Recruiting Shallan Davar
A man identified with the Ghostbloods was financing [[Lin Davar\|Lin Davar]] in his bid to become [[Highprince\|Highprince]] of [[Veden\|Veden]], [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]]. After an unknown [[Veden\|Veden]] [[Shardbearer\|Shardbearer]] attacked Amaram, Amaram speculated that [[Thaidakar\|Thaidakar]] and the Ghostbloods were behind the attack. The unknown shardbearer turned out to be [[Helaran Davar\|Helaran Davar]], [[Shallan\|Shallan's]] brother.
The Ghostbloods were sought out by Shallan Davar, who, under the disguise of Veil, wanted to investigate them. Shallan met with Mraize and Iyatil in a Ghostblood hideout located in [[Sebarial\|Sebarial's]] warcamp, and managed to trick them into believing that she was sent there by [[Tyn\|Tyn]]. Mraize, unaware that Tyn was dead, ordered Shallan to tell Tyn to investigate the quarters of Meridas Amaram. Shallan successfully performed this task, and brought her findings to Mraize, which led to her accidentally revealing her photographic memory. Mraize then deduced that Tyn was dead, killed by Shallan, but commended her for it. He then told her that she could get a place among the Ghostbloods if she completed tasks for them. However, he also allowed other Ghostbloods to attempt to murder her if they wanted to. Shallan managed to avoid the attempts on her life, and carried out her next task, to investigate [[Taln\|Taln's]] presence in the warcamp of [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]], to a satisfactory manner.
After the Battle of Narak, and the subsequent discovery of Urithiru, Mraize confronted Shallan, and revealed that he had figured out her real identity as Lin Davar's daughter, Jasnah Kholin's ward, and a Knight Radiant with the ability to Soulcast. Mraize reminded her of her family's debt to the Ghostbloods, and also revealed that Ghostblood agents had rescued her brothers from the civil war in Jah Keved, and would bring them safely to Urithiru. The Ghostblood operatives succeeded, and the Davar brothers arrived in Urithiru after the Battle of Thaylen Fields.
Shallan's identities debated their interest in joining the Ghostbloods. Veil was interested in joining, but refused to get the tattoo. Shallan planned to break ties with the Ghostbloods. Formless, an imagined fourth identity for Shallan where she hid her self doubt and selfish ambitions, wanted to join the Ghostbloods.
Mraize offered Shallan full membership in the Ghostbloods in return for assassinating [[Restares\|Restares]], leader of the [[Sons of Honor\|Sons of Honor]]. Shallan did not go through with it and broke ties with the group. She threatened Mraize to leave [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] and warned him that she would be hunting for [[Ba-Ado-Mishram\|Ba-Ado-Mishram]]. Mraize warned her that she'd moved against the group in the most offensive of ways.

>“*This will not end well for you, Shallan. You make an enemy of the most powerful organization in all the cosmere.*”
\-Mraize to Shallan[21]


### Cleansing Urithiru
Mraize asked [[Shallan\|Shallan]] to investigate the wrongness in Urithiru, which she was already sensing. This led her to find, confront, and expel [[Re-Shephir\|Re-Shephir]].

### Pursuit of the Sons of Honor
The Ghostbloods wished to keep an eye on the activities of House Sadeas, and Mraize was personally spying on them, acting as a guard to [[Ialai Sadeas\|Ialai Sadeas]] in Urithiru. They murdered [[Thanadal\|Thanadal]] and [[Vamah\|Vamah]]. They struck at Ialai several times and ultimately succeeded when [[Shallan\|Shallan]] assassinated her with [[Blackbane\|Blackbane]], though Shallan claimed she did this for the good of [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]].
Shallan and the [[Unseen Court\|Unseen Court]] searched Ialai's bed chambers and found a notebook containing many Ghostblood secrets, including a map of [[Shadesmar\|Shadesmar]], a route through the [[Sea of Lost Lights\|Sea of Lost Lights]], and [[Thaidakar\|Thaidakar's]] supposed offworld origins.
Shallan hunted [[Restares\|Restares]] to [[Lasting Integrity\|Lasting Integrity]]. Restares was an alias for the [[Herald\|Herald]] [[Kalak\|Kalak]]. After an internal struggle, Shallan decided against killing him. She offered to share information about the Ghostbloods. He claimed to be close to getting offworld.

### Recruiting Sja-anat
During her wedding, Shallan is instructed in a letter from Mraize to recruit [[Sja-anat\|Sja-anat]] into the Ghostbloods. [[Mraize\|Mraize]] requested a bond between a Ghostblood and one of her "enlightened" spren. Shallan only arranged a meeting. Sja-anat sent [[Tumi\|Tumi]], who ended up bonding [[Rlain\|Rlain]].

### Bringing other forms of Investiture to Roshar
The Ghostbloods have plans to commercialize [[Investiture\|Investiture]] on a much larger scale than what happened on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. In these efforts they bring [[Sand (Taldain)\|sand]] from [[Taldain\|Taldain]], [[Seon\|Seons]] from [[Sel\|Sel]], and [[Aviar\|Aviars]] from [[First of the Sun\|First of the Sun]] to [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. They want to use the [[Oathgate\|Oathgates]] to facilitate the trade of these items on Roshar, as they would not need to rely on [[Perpendicularity\|perpendicularities]]. Mraize also mentions that perfect gemstones would be a good tool for carrying Stormlight off Roshar; [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah]] has noted that there are nowhere near as many perfect gemstones in circulation as there should be, which leads [[Adolin Kholin\|Adolin]] to theorize that a group that is aware of their importance—like the Ghostbloods—has been secretly collecting them. The [[Honorspren\|honorspren]] of [[Lasting Integrity\|Lasting Integrity]] have collected several perfect gemstones over millennia, though it is unclear how many they have compared to how many Jasnah thinks there should be.

### Resistance against Trell
The Ghostbloods on Scadrial worked in order to resist the oncoming threat of [[Trell (Trellism)\|Trell]].
On 348 [[Catacendre\|PC]] the Ghostbloods attempted to recruit [[Marasi Colms\|Marasi Colms]] and sent [[Wan ShaiLu\|Moonlight]] to deliver a message to her telling that the Ghostbloods were watching her and were impressed.
Several days later the Ghostbloods contacted [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] via [[Seon\|Seon]] in their hideout in [[Bilming\|Bilming]] informing him that the [[Set\|Set]] had developed a bomb to destroy [[Elendel\|Elendel]].
After Kelsier informed the Ghostbloods that he wouldn't get to Bilming in time, [[Prasanva\|TwinSoul]], Moonlight and Marasi discovered and infiltrated the Set's underground [[Wayfarer\|caverns]]. Since Moonlight and Marasi were discovered and confronted by Set soldiers after Marasi's attempt to save a group of people from execution, Moonlight used a [[Soulstamp\|soulstamp]] to rewrite her history and become an [[Elantrian\|Elantrian]] so Marasi could escape.. Ghostblood agents in Elendel were ordered to assist the local authorities with organising the evacuation, as they too would not reach Bilming in time.
After [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Wax]] and [[Wayne\|Wayne]] stopped the bomb that the Set sent to Elendel, Marasi met with Kelsier and the Ghostbloods in Elendel and told them that she wouldn't join with them, because of their rule of keeping their information secret. After that TwinSoul supposedly went on a mission to track down Moonlight.

## Trivia
The name of the Ghostbloods means something, and has roots in specific [[Cosmere\|cosmere]] events.
The Ghostbloods would actively recruit from the [[Seventeenth Shard\|Seventeenth Shard]], particularly from their field agents.
They are not working together with the Seventeenth Shard.
The Ghostbloods find [[Hoid\|Hoid]] intriguing.
The Ghostbloods do not trust the [[Sleepless\|Sleepless]]. They are worried about having their organization taken over.
The third Mistborn series will be subtitled 'Ghostbloods'.
