## Appearance and Personality
Dalar is a lanky man, and he only has three fingers on one of his hands. During wartime, he is curt.

## History
Dalar was a superior officer to both [[Tien\|Tien]] and [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] in Amaram's army. He was charged with assigning newly made squads from the reserves to replace those that had been lost.
Tien had been assigned to a team of deep reserves made up of messenger boys inexperienced in fighting; Dalar claimed that these reserves would never be used unless the army was in serious danger.
During a border skirmish with [[Hallaw\|Hallaw's]] forces in 1169, Kaladin realized that members of Tien's reserve team had been assigned to combat, due to a lack of new recruits. Kaladin frantically searched for Tien, and in the process he found Dalar standing beside a tall post with a pair of triangular banners. Dalar told Kaladin that Tien was assigned to Brightlord [[Sheler\|Sheler's]] company on the southeast side of the hill, and Kaladin immediately set off to find him.
