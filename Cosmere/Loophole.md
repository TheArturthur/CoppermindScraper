### Weaknesses
Loophole has a fear of sneezing. When anyone sneezes in her presence, anyone or any objects altered in size return to normal size.

## History
Nothing is known of her life before she became an Epic. She was known as being one of the most powerful Epics in Ildithia. Loophole spent her time arranging parties and being a mercenary, offering her services to any powerful Epics that would pay her.
Before [[Limelight\|Limelight]] came to Ildithia, Loophole was working for [[Larcener\|Larcener]], who allowed her to throw parties every week in [[Sharp Tower\|Sharp Tower]]. Prof allowed her to continue after he became the dominant Epic of the city. In the final battle between the Reckoners and Prof, she aided Prof by grabbing a [[Motivator\|motivator]] from [[Cody\|Cody]]. She fought [[David Charleston\|David]] during the battle and fell into a narrow chasm while small; she then accidentally expanded due to her Epic weakness, crushing herself to death. After her death, David briefly saw an alternate reality version of Loophole fighting [[Firefight (Epic)\|Firefight]].
