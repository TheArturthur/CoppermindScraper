## Appearance and Anatomy
Tonks are quadrupedal. Their heads and the front halves of their bodies are similar in size and shape to a mule, while their hindquarters more closely resemble those of a kangaroo. Their bodies are covered in gray carapace, which is segmented and particularly thick along the top of the body. They have long, thick tails, prominent horns coming out of their heads at various angles, and clawed feet that appear to have opposable thumbs.
The horns and carapace can be dissolved by water; even a few drops can dissolve most of a horn. As a result of this, they do not drink water and only eat sand in large quantities.
They always give off a faint sulfurous smell and their flatulence is particularly odorous. [[Khrissalla\|Khrissalla]] suspects that sandlings can somehow metabolize sand, although she does not understand the science behind the process. Their droppings are known as tonk guano.

## Usage and Behavior
>“*Riding tonks have very weak minds. Whenever they get confused they assume it's a sandstorm and bury themselves beneath the ground.*”
\-Kenton, to Khrissalla[6]

Tonks are often used for transportation in the deserts of [[Dayside\|Dayside]], carrying both riders and supplies. They are weak-minded and easy to lead. Calling someone a tonk in Dayside is considered an insult, presumably because it implies that they are slow-witted.
When used for riding, they are fitted with a saddle, bridle, and saddlebags. On longer trips through the desert, tonks may be fitted with vessels to carry extra water. Tonks are usually trained to turn or adjust their speed when tapped with a riding mallet on different parts of their carapace; riders may also use reins to help direct them. When they are scared or confused, they tend to bury themselves in the sand with only their horns exposed. Tapping the horns signals the tonk that it is safe to unbury itself. Skilled riders such as [[Aarik\|Aarik]] may be able to prevent tonks from burying themselves when under duress. Tonks are present in hunting camps in the [[Deep sand\|deep sand]], although [[Terha\|terhan]] are preferred for hunts as they are both larger and faster than tonks.
They are sometimes used by [[Darkside\|Darksiders]] that are visiting Dayside, but this may be rare, as Khrissalla and her team do not appear to be very familiar with their behavior.

## Taxonomy
Tonks are considered part of the sandling family. They have a number of characteristics also seen in terhan and other sandling species, such as horns, water-soluble carapace, and a propensity to bury themselves in sand. It is unknown if there is a relation, natural or bred, between the various sandling species.

## Trivia
The name "tonk" is not related to the character [[Tonk Fah\|Tonk Fah]].
