## Appearance and Personality
Toral is a keen young [[Lighteyed\|lighteyed]] man. He has a refined sense of taste, likes wine, and wears fashionable clothing. He has an insight into politics and speaks intelligently.

## History
The day of [[Adolin\|Adolin's]] duel with [[Brightlord\|Brightlord]] [[Resi\|Resi]], Toral met with Adolin at a winehouse along with [[Eshava\|Eshava]], [[Danlan Morakotha\|Danlan Morakotha]], [[Jakamav\|Jakamav]], and [[Inkima\|Inkima]]. After some lighthearted discussion about being wrong, Adolin moved the topic of conversation to [[Torol Sadeas\|Torol Sadeas]], and Toral offered his opinion on why the highprince hadn't moved against [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]]. He mentioned that Dalinar's reputation was lacking but claimed that he meant no offense by the comment. Toral was perplexed by Adolin's defense of his father, as he thought Adolin chafed at Dalinar's way of running his [[House Kholin\|house]]. His last statement, that people were saying that Dalinar should abdicate, weighed on Adolin as he went to his duel.
