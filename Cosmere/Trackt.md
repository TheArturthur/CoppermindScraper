## History
During the crisis in the [[Diem\|Diem]], the trackts were seeking to capture the crime lord [[Sharezan\|Sharezan]]. After the [[Taisha\|Taishin]] gave [[Kenton\|Kenton]] two weeks to rally support for the Diem, Lady Judge Heelis removed Senior Trackt [[Ais\|Ais]] from heading the search for [[Sharezan\|Sharezan]] and assigned her as a bodyguard for [[Kenton\|Kenton]] to spy on him and report back about his actions and character. In the meanwhile Ais put [[Tain\|Tain]] in charge of the investigation. After successfully raiding one of Sharezanâ€™s dens and hearing that one of his main allies wants to split with the organization, the trackts offered sanctuary for them in return for information. When that ally, Lord General [[Raagent\|Raagent]], tried to meet up with them, however, Sharezan caused an explosion at the meeting place. Once Raagent went missing, he was found murdered by Sharezan with his eyelids cut off in his chilling cellar for wine.
After hearing from Tain that [[Lokmlen\|Lokmlen]], one of Sharezan's associates who Ais captured when she was still heading the investigation, broke, Ais went with him to the supposed location of Sharezan's safehouse where Tain revealed that he is Sharezan and gave Ais the choice between rescuing her family or the children at the orphanage where she grew up. She told an unnamed trackt that she ran into on her way home to go to the orphanage and arrived at her house to see Kenton defeating Tain. Tain was then imprisoned to be tried for his crimes.
After all of this took place, Ais decided to resign from the trackts and left Lossand with her family.
