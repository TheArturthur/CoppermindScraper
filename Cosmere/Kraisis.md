**Kraisis** is a brown haired man on [[Mirandus\|Mirandus]] who [[Illarion\|Illarion]] groomed to be the [[Destined One\|Destined One]] from a young age.

## Attributes and Abilities
Kraisis has some magical ability taught to him by Illarion, being the one to create the doorway for [[Sir Ysla\|Sir Ysla]] to travel to [[Earth (Dark One)\|Earth]] under Illarion's instructions, to hunt down [[Paul Tanasin\|Paul Tanasin]] before he can come into his powers as the [[Dark One (title)\|Dark One]].
Kraisis is a capable fighter, spending many of his waking hours training to be a great fighter. Kraisis proves his fighting ability when [[Feotora\|Feotora]] challenges him to a mock battle to vent her anger, and would have defeated her if not for Illarion's intervention.

## History
Kraisis was discovered as the next person to be the Destined One by Illarion, sometime during Kraisis' youth. Illarion trained Kraisis in using a sword and spells throughout his childhood.
Under Illarion's instruction, Kraisis recruited Sir Ysla and set up the ritual to transport the knight to [[Earth (Dark One)\|Earth]], to track down and kill the Dark One Illarion proclaimed to be starting their rise.
Feotora brought word of Paul Tanasin's rise as the latest Dark One, when he gave himself away during the fight against a drull camp. She and Kraisis had a mock duel to relieve tension, before the King [[Gosovic\|Gosovic's]] death during the night. Kraisis helped lead a campaign to defeat Paul and the [[Drull\|drull]] at [[Pitch\|Pitch]] soon after Feotora was crowned queen. Despite bringing Paul to his knees during the battle, Paul killed Kraisis, returning his soul to the soil to raise more drull and bring about their first victory against the [[Kingdoms of Light\|Kingdoms of Light]].
