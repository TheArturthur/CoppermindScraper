The **Midnight Sea** is an ocean on [[Lumar\|Lumar]], made up of [[Aether\| Midnight Aether]] [[Aether spores\| spores]]. The only known inhabited land was the [[Sorceress' island\|Sorceress' island]], where the [[Sorceress\|Sorceress]] lived until she was driven away by [[Tress\|Tress]] and [[Hoid\|Hoid]]. Like all seas on Lumar, it is pentagonal in shape.
It is notably warm compared to other seas due to taking in large amounts of heat from the sun due to their deep black color. The sound of the seethe apparently is also different from the other seas, but it is not clear if this is a true difference, or merely a psychological effect.
The Midnight Sea is the most dangerous of seas on Lumar due to the presence of the Sorceress and her [[Midnight Essence\|Midnight Essence]] servants, which hunt those who cross into their domain. These are hard to notice in the liquidized spores, as they as black as the spores themselves, thus camouflage into it.
It borders the [[Crimson Sea\|Crimson Sea]], and four other unknown seas. It is surrounded by several mountain ranges, making the Crimson Sea one of the only viable entrances.

## Trivia
Prior to the release of *Tress of the Emerald Sea*, Brandon suggested that Midnight Sea is sometimes called "Sea of Night"; however, the phrase does not appear in the book, making its canonicity questionable.
