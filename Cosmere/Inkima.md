[[Brightlady\|Brightlady]] **Inkima** is a woman on Roshar who lived in the [[Alethi\|Alethi]] warcamps at the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]].
She accompanies [[Jakamav\|Jakamav]] to a wine tasting in the [[Outer Market\|Outer Market]] with [[Adolin Kholin\|Adolin Kholin]] and several other [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]]. (including [[Danlan Morakotha\|Danlan Morakotha]], [[Toral\|Toraland]] ) Later, Adolin invites her and Jakamav to a second wine bar but was rebuffed due to the [[Kholin\|Kholins']] ill favor after the [[Battle of the Tower\|Battle of the Tower]].
Inkima is a plump woman with yellow eyes and hair that she dyed black, indicating that she is likely not of pure Alethi blood. The color red did not suit Inkima, in Adolin's opinion. She has a tinkling laugh that Adolin found obnoxious. Inkima seems to be quite taken with Jakamav, laughing at everything he said.
She is an acquaintance of Prince Adolin Kholin, and accompanied Toral and some other young lighteyes (including Danlan Morakotha, Jakamav and Inkima)
