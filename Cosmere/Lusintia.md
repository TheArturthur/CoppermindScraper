**Lusintia** is an [[Honorspren\|honorspren]] from [[Lasting Integrity\|Lasting Integrity]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Appearance and Personality
Lusintia is an [[Honorspren\|honorspren]] who appears as a short women wearing a stiff jacket and trousers that give the appearance of a uniform, with chin-long hair.
She is very loyal to the idea that the honorspren are right to isolate themselves from the humans, and she is willing to act as a guard on the [[Lightweaver\|Lightweaver]] [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]]. Lusintia is outraged by the idea of Shallan colluding with [[Kalak\|Kalak]], though she holds a great reverence for the [[Herald\|Herald]] himself. She has a softer side as well, which shows when she frantically asks [[Pattern\|Pattern]] for advice following Shallan's "accident" and when she assures Shallan that they would not have let her die. Like other honorspren, Lusintia is ignorant of the types of subterfuge that humans sometimes use.

## History
Lusintia acted as a guide for [[Shallan\|Shallan]] on her first day in [[Lasting Integrity\|Lasting Integrity]]. She was also assigned to watch her covertly, meaning that she was immediately on scene when Shallan fell from a tree. Flustered, Lusintia and a number of other honorspren were tricked by Pattern into believing that Shallan required [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]] to heal. After carrying her to the room where the honorspren stored their Stormlight, Lusintia was embarrassed to realize that Shallan used up an entire emerald [[Sphere\|sphere]] and had to stay back to fill out a report. As Formless, Shallan later impersonated Lusintia while attempting to assassinate [[Kalak\|Kalak]]. When a group of honorspren led by [[Sekeir\|Sekeir]] interrupted Shallan while she spoke with the Herald, Lusintia accused her of attempting to influence the course of her husband, [[Adolin Kholin\|Adolin Kholin's]] trial.
