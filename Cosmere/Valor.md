**Valor** is a [[Shard\|Shard]] of [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]] that has not been [[/wiki/Splinter#Formation]] and whose Vessel is an unknown female.

## History
Like all Shards except [[Harmony\|Harmony]], Valor was created at the [[Shattering\|Shattering]] of [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]], and picked up by an unknown Vessel. It is not known what Valor did directly after her Ascension, or where she settled, if she settled at all.
Some time around the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], on the advice of [[Hoid\|Hoid]], Harmony reached out to Valor about the threat posed by [[Odium\|Odium]]; their conversation left him with the impression that she is reasonable. At her request, he later encouraged Hoid to try approaching her again, as she felt it had been too long since their last conversation.

## Trivia
The unpublished novella *[[Adamant\|Adamant]]* includes in-world curses of 'Valor'.
