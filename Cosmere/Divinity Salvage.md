## History
After his mother sacrificed herself to become a [[Sunheart\|sunheart]], Divinity installed the sunheart in his and Rebeke's [[Hovercycle\|quadcycle]] so that Rebeke could have it near her.
Divinity and Rebeke rode on their quadcycle together during the rescue mission at [[Union\|Union]]. Despite the explicit orders of the [[Greater Good\|Greater Good]] to the contrary, they planned to find and take Elegy during the assault. Divinity carries a rifle, likely indicating that he is a hunter. When [[Nomad\|Nomad]] calls out for help, Rebeke briefly turns to regard him but Divinity is thoroughly focused on finding Elegy and does not look. Divinity is rewarded for his diligence as he is the one to find the semi-conscious Elegy and along with Rebeke, haul her to their cycle and strap her to the right side back seat.
The [[Cinder King\|Cinder King]] shoots Divinity twice with his energy rifle from the deck of his ship. The first shot hits his shoulder causing him to scream in pain and stumble backwards then the next shot vaporizes his head, killing him instantly. Under continuing fire, Rebeke is forced to leave Divinity's body behind in Union's arena.
When visiting the [[Chorus\|Chorus']] Reliquary, Rebeke believes she sees Divinity's face among the [[Shade\|shades]]. However, this is almost certainly untrue as the [[Investiture\|Investiture]] of those who die on Canticle gets converted into a sunheart instead of a shade, even if the person did not die from the sunlight directly.

## Relationships
### Rebeke
Divinity cares for Rebeke's wellbeing after the death of their mother, installing their mother's sunheart into their hovercycle so that Rebeke can be close to it. After his death, Rebeke is deeply hurt by her brother's loss. The grief at his loss is a major factor in her persistence that the Cinder King must be defeated and helps her to convince the people on Union's command bridge to resist him.

### Elegy
Before her conversion into a [[Charred\|Charred]], Elegy's position as Beacon's [[Lodestar\|Lodestar]] afforded Divinity a smaller measure of authority. After her conversion, Elegy has no memory whatsoever of Divinity. He in turn treats her with extreme caution, strapping her down in the hovercycle seat even though she is barely conscious at the time. However, he is fervent in his desire to find her, knowingly risking his life to do so.
