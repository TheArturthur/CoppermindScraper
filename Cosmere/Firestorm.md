## Appearance
Like all dead Shardblades, Firestorm is massive, about six feet long. It has a long, straight handle with a ring pommel and no crossguard. There is presumably a [[Polestone\|Polestone]] attached somewhere on the hilt, but the type and location of the gem are unknown. The blade's symmetrical shape resembles abstract flames burning in the direction of the handle, broad near the base and coming to a sharp point at the very tip. Its appearance is sometimes described as "wicked". The silvery metal of the blade almost seems to glow in low light.

## Properties
For more information, see Shardblade#Dead Shardblades.
Firestorm has magical qualities that are similar to other dead Shardblades. It is the physical manifestation of a [[Deadeye\|deadeye]] [[Spren\|spren]] whose [[Nahel bond\|Nahel bond]] with a [[Surgebinder\|Surgebinder]] was broken. Firestorm can be summoned or dismissed at will by whomever has bonded it, and it can easily cut through almost anything with very little resistance.

## History
Little is known of Firestorm's early history, including the nature of its [[Spren\|spren]]. Most dead Blades were created on the [[Day of Recreance\|Day of Recreance]], but it is not known if Firestorm was one of them.

### Bonded to Gavilar
[[Gavilar\|Gavilar]] bonded Firestorm at a relatively young age, but the exact circumstances are unclear. It is possible he inherited it, as the Kholin household had wooden practice Shardblades in his childhood and Gavilar was once considered fourth [[Dahn\|dahn]], consistent with the level of a Shardbearer. He wielded Firestorm with devastating effect at the first battle of the [[Rift\|Rift]] circa 1141, and he already seemed quite familiar with it at the time. He continued to use Firestorm throughout the war of unification. Gavilar was highly trained in the use of a Shardblade and an exceptionally skilled swordsman; he did not rely solely on the power of the Blade like other wielders often did.

 by  Thorkild Skov  Gavilar's duel with Szeth
Once Gavilar became king, he allowed Firestorm to be loaned out to [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]] as one of the King's Blades for dueling and practice, although he only did so grudgingly.
He used Firestorm to defend himself from [[Szeth\|Szeth]] when the assassin [[Assassination of Gavilar\|attacked him at the palace]] in 1167. Although Gavilar's face was hidden by [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]], his skill with the Blade actually helped reveal his identity to Szeth. Gavilar put up a good fight, but Szeth had the advantage of Surgebinding due to his [[Honorblade\|Honorblade]] and eventually gained the upper hand in their duel. Firestorm appeared when Gavilar died, but Szeth left it behind as he had no interest in it.

### Post-Gavilar
Following Gavilar's death, Firestorm's ownership passed on to his heir, King [[Elhokar\|Elhokar]]. Elhokar did not bond Firestorm since he already had his own Shardblade, [[Sunraiser\|Sunraiser]]. Firestorm's role shifted to that of a full-time King's Blade that was used by [[Ardent\|ardents]] and loaned out frequently for training. For example, [[Resi\|Resi]] borrowed the Blade and wielded it in a duel against [[Adolin\|Adolin]], as did [[Eranniv\|Eranniv]]. Elhokar was said to have considered bestowing Firestorm to a worthy warrior, but he never did so. One of the King's Blades, likely Firestorm, was used during the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]] by [[Teleb\|Teleb]].
The Blade's subsequent fate is unknown. It was presumably taken to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] along with the rest of the [[House Kholin\|Kholin]] warcamp. Assuming that the Blade remained in Alethkar's control when Elhokar died, its ownership would have transferred to Queen [[Jasnah Kholin\|Jasnah Kholin]].

## Trivia
Gavilar has a habit of summoning and dismissing Firestorm time after time when he's about to engage in battle. His nephew [[Adolin\|Adolin]] does the same with [[Mayalaran\|Mayalaran]].
Firestorm is never named in the text proper of [[The Stormlight Archive\|The Stormlight Archive]]. The name only appears in [[Shallan\|Shallan's]] [[Shallan's sketchbook\|sketchbook]] drawing of the royal Shardblades, which was created by [[Ben McSweeney\|Ben McSweeney]]. As such, it's unclear whether Gavilar called the blade by that name or if it came to be known as Firestorm after his death.
