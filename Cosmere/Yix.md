**Yix** is a member of [[Macob\|Macob's]] caravan.
He has golden hair and is likely of [[Iriali\|Iriali]] descent. He is potentially multilingual, though it is unknown which languages he speaks. He wears tan clothing and carries a sword, though unlike in [[Vorin\|Vorin]] society, this is not necessarily indicative of his rank. He is a highly suspicious person and good at moving stealthily.
He works under [[Tyn\|Tyn]] while travelling with Macob's caravan across the Frostlands and performed duties as a scout. Yix and Tyn found [[Shallan\|Shallan]] and [[Tvlakv\|Tvlakv]] spying on their camp after the caravan had fled a group of bandits. It is likely that Yix died defending the caravan when it was attacked a second time by the bandits.
