## Appearance and Personality
Morriumur is a young dione draft with their face split down the center, the right being a crimson color while the left is a blue shade. They have a tall and muscular build. Because they are a dione, they are expected to be non-aggressive, but the current draft of their personality is very aggressive by dione standards. They feel that they have to prove themself and fear being re-drafted because they do not wish to forget their friends. They sometimes curse profusely, but not when they know others can hear them.

## Attributes and Abilities
Morriumur is a draft, and because of their dual-minded nature they are immune to the hallucinations of a [[Delver\|delver's]] maze.

## History
### Early Life and Recruitment
When Morriumur was born, they inherited some flying skills from their leftparent, who was a commercial pilot. Morriumur was born with an aggressive personality, and therefore wanted to prove themself. To do this, Morriumur volunteered to be a part of a new pilot recruitment program when they were two months old. In order to make it into the program, Morriumur participated in a skill test orchestrated by Winzik. Morriumur and around five hundred other prospective pilots engaged in a battle against Krell drones, with the objective of staying alive for thirty minutes. [[Brade\|Brade]] used Morriumur's ship as an anchor to perform a sharp turn with a [[Light-lance\|light-lance]], sending Morriumur's ship into a collision with an asteroid. The collision damaged one of their boosters and knocked out their emergency lights, leaving Morriumur unable to surrender and leave the test. They put out a distress call on the general comm line, and were rescued by [[Spensa Nightshade\|Spensa Nightshade]], [[Hesho\|Hesho]], and [[Vapor\|Vapor]]. Morriumur stayed with Hesho and Spensa for the remainder of the fight, and passed the test.
After the test, Morriumur stopped Spensa from yelling at Winzik about the test, and the two went and ate together. Spensa, posing as the [[UrDail\|UrDail]] pilot [[Alanik\|Alanik]], asked Morriumur many questions about dione drafts and dione reproduction, which Morriumur answered. They were joined by Hesho and his crew, and the three of them agreed to be allies.

### Flowers of Night's Last Kiss
Morriumur was originally assigned to be in their own solo flight, but Spensa argued on their behalf, and convinced the officials to put Morriumur on her flight, along with Brade, Hesho, and Vapor. On the first day of official training, Morriumur and the others in their flight boarded the *[[Weights and Measures\|Weights and Measures]]*, the FTL transport ship that took them to the training grounds. En route, Hesho renamed their flight to Flowers of Night's Last Kiss. Spensa declared that everyone should have a callsign, and gave Morriumur the callsign "Complains", which Morriumur despondently accepted. The flight organizes themselves and does some basic maneuvers, then begins the training regimen for fighting [[Delver\|delvers]]. Though they were supposed to practice navigating a constructed delver maze to simulate fighting a delver, Spensa had the flight work on formations and maneuvers instead, due to the group needing work on the fundamentals of flying as a cohesive unit. Morriumur doesn't perform particularly well, and accidentally shoots at Spensa during the exercises.
On a day off from training, Morriumur visited Spensa's living quarters to talk to her. Morriumur expressed their self-doubt to Spensa, wondering if they're worth training, and Spensa said that they are. Morriumur took Spensa for a walk to visit a water garden, and the two discussed Morriumur's parents and the nature of the Superiority. Upon returning to Spensa's apartment, Morriumur spotted [[Doomslug\|Doomslug]], Spensa's pet [[Taynix\|taynix]]. Morriumur was appalled, and warned Spensa that taynix are extremely deadly, but Spensa reassured them that the creature just closely resembles a taynix. Morriumur warned Spensa to keep it hidden, then leaves. Some time later, Morriumur participated in another practice session with the delver maze, this time being observed by several high-ranking Superiority officials.

### Arrival of the Delver
After a decoy drone created by Spensa was found aboard the *[[Weights and Measures\|Weights and Measures]]*, Winzik issued an order for all pilots to report to the *Weights and Measures* for immediate departure. He announced that the drone contained a weapon that was human in origin, and they were going to hyperjump to [[Detritus\|Detritus]] and wipe out the [[Defiant Defense Force\|human military force]] there. Morriumur was worried, telling Spensa that they were trained to fight Delvers, not humans. At the last minute, Morriumur chose not to go and decided they were done being a pilot.
Morriumur went back to their family, who decided that they didn't like the current draft of Morriumur. Their family decided that they should try again, and they all gathered to say goodbye. Though they assured Morriumur that they shouldn't take it as a rejection, but Morriumur couldn't help but see it that way. Their family saw them as too aggressive, and were disappointed that they'd chosen to become a pilot. As Morriumur got into the drafting pod and was about to be redrafted, the entire room shook. Morriumur looked and saw that a delver was attacking Starsight. Though both halves of their mind told them to flee, instead Morriumur went to help stop the delver. They boarded an unarmed shuttle equipped with an industrial light-lance, then flew out towards the delver. Spensa and Vapor tried to get to the delver's heart, but got separated. Spensa became disoriented by the visions projected into her mind by the delver, but Morriumur came to her rescue. Because of Morriumur's nature as a draft, the delver projected two different visions to the different halves of their brain. Morriumur was able to easily see through the projections, and guide Spensa to the delver's heart. There was air and gravity inside the heart, and Morriumur got out of their ship to get Spensa out of her cockpit. There was a deep black hole in the heart, which Morriumur helped Spensa jump into.
Shortly after, the delver vanished, and Spensa appeared floating in space. Morriumur acted quickly, pulling Spensa into their ship's cockpit. Morriumur returned to Starsight carrying Spensa, and was greeted with cheers. They were confused, thinking people would be angry when they flew into battle. Once Morriumur became a celebrity, their family changed their minds about redrafting them, and the draft of Morriumur was born as a newborn purple dione.
