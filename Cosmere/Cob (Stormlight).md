**Cob** is a man in [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] known to [[Hoid\|Hoid]] after the coming of the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]].
He was married to [[Kheni\|Kheni]]; they had a small child who was killed under unknown circumstances during the fighting in and around Kholinar. Kheni went into a catatonic state as a result; Cob stayed with her to take care of her, always hovering nearby. A disguised Hoid met them and some other refugees on several occasions. When Hoid brought Cob and Kheni an orphaned girl to take care of, Cob asked if he could stay a little longer, which Hoid did not believe he had ever been asked before.
