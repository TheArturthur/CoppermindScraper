## Geography
### Territories and Features
#### Territories and borders
Thalath lies in the south-eastern part of [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. To the north, it borders [[Alethela\|Alethela]] while to the east, it borders [[Natanatan\|Natanatan]]. It also borders the [[Southern Depths\|Southern Depths]] to the south and contains an island close to [[Valhav\|Valhav]] and [[Makabakam\|Makabakam]]. It also borders the [[Tarat Sea\|Tarat Sea]] and contains [[Longbrow's Straits\|Longbrow's Straits]]. The capital, Thaylen city, is located on a large island in the south of the nation.

#### Geographic Features
Most of Thalath lies near the sea, mainly the Tarat sea, the Longbrow's straits and the Southern Depths. Much of Thalath consists of Islands, although the majority is part of the mainland. Thalath has almost no large rivers running through it. The kingdom has a single mountain ranges of note, that being the inner region of the Thaylenah island.

## Culture
#### Ethnicity and People
As modern Thaylens descend from them, it is likely that they are ethnically similar. The people of Thalath are tanned and have . They would typically have been short, although some could have grown as tall as the modern [[Alethi\|Alethi]]. Their most recognizable, distinguishing feature would be their long white eyebrows. There seems to be no upper limit on how long these can grow, other than sheer practicality. The men from Thalath additionally have white beards, regardless of their age or the color of their hair. The people of Thalath are also experts in sailing and naval warfare, and they control Roshar’s largest fleet.

#### Writing and language
It can reasonably be assumed that the people of Thalath spoke a distant ancestor of modern day Thaylen. This language belongs to the [[Vorin\|Vorin]] language family, which also contains the languages of the Alethi, the Herdazian, the Natan, and the Veden peoples, although Thaylen is not terribly similar to these languages. The people of Thalath wrote in the [[Dawnchant\|Dawnchant]]. After a while, they adapted the original Dawnchant script to fit their own language and developed their own script. This process began with simple phonetic substitution, in which they used the Dawnchant to transcribe their own language.

## History
### Creation of Roshar
The land that would become known as Thalath was created at an unknown point before the [[Shattering\|Shattering]] by [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]], along with the rest of Roshar and the Rosharan supercontinent over ten-thousand years prior to Vorin year 1174. It is unclear how much the geography of Thalath has changed compared to the land at creation.

### Pre-Human Arrival
Before humanity arrived on Roshar from Ashyn, the land that would come to be known as Thalath was inhabited by [[Singers\|Singers]].
Circa -5825 in the Vorin calendar, humanity arrived on Roshar after fleeing Ashyn and were granted the land that would become [[Shin Kak Nish\|Shin Kak Nish]]. After less than a generation, they headed an invasion, slaughtering some of the Singers and expelling them from their land, claiming it as their own, this included the land that would come to be known as Thalath. This history was lost to man until the discovery of the [[Eila Stele\|Eila Stele]].

### The Establishment of Thalath
  Map of the Silver Kingdoms
Thalath was founded in the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]] Epoch. Due to the Desolations, the people of Thalath were constantly returned back to early technological levels, often to the point of having to make use of stone tools. Though they advanced each time with the help of the Heralds whenever they returned, often receiving this assistance from [[Kalak\|Kalak]] and his [[Willshapers\|Willshapers]]. Old manuscripts and texts dating back to these times mention quick-spreading diseases in the east that killed tens of thousands, and it is likely that at least some of these diseases spread to Thalath.
Very early in the nation's history [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]] was created and made into its capital. Thaylen city was eventually made into the home of the Thalath Oathgate.

#### Further Desolations
The Sixth Epoch lasted at least thirty-one years, and likely significantly longer, before its Desolation arrived.
One of the many Desolations that struck the nation, along with the rest of Roshar, arrived in the year 337 of the Eighth Epoch. This Desolation was heralded by the release of [[Midnight Essence\|Midnight Essence]] in a small settlement in [[Natanatan\|Natanatan]]. The length of this Desolation is unknown.
Another Desolation occurred later and ended circa -3333, during an unknown Epoch. This left society wounded and weak, forcing them into a period of recovery.

#### The Last Desolation (c.-3332)
The Last Desolation was a large scale Desolation which occurred circa -3332, around 4500 years before the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]]. This Desolation was particularly devasting due to the fact that it happened only a year after the previous Desolation, and thus society was weakened and still recovering. Tired of the Desolations and their torture on Braize, the nine Heralds still on Roshar refused to return to Braize, leaving Taln as the sole Herald on the planet for millennia.
After the Last Desolation, Desolations ceased to ravage the nation. Due to this, society was able to advance much further than ever before, giving them the strength to potentially resist any potential Desolation without complete societal collapse. The era heralded by the Last Desolation came to be known as the Era of Solitude.

#### After Aharietiam
At some unknown point in history, after Aharietiam, Thalath collapsed. 4500 years after the Last Desolation, much of the land that had been ruled by Thalath is abandoned and unclaimed by anyone. Thalath’s legacy persists in [[Thaylenah\|Thaylenah]] however, a state that has kept much of Thalath culture and ideals.
