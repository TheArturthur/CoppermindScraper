**Tark Vestingdow** is a man from [[Tinweight Settlement\|Tinweight Settlement]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]] whom [[Wayne\|Wayne]] knows as a child. His [[Terris\|Terris]] heritage causes Wayne to feel inferior when he realizes that he isn't as obedient as most Terris.
In 319 [[Catacendre\|PC]], Tark left a deck of cards in his overalls that he sent to be laundered. [[Wayne\|Wayne]] found that deck and used them to try to learn cards, since he wanted to earn a good living with them. [[Wayne's mother\|Wayne's mother]] confiscated the cards; knowing that she would spend time looking for their owner, Wayne confessed whose clothes the cards had arrived in so that she could save time in returning them straight to Tark.
