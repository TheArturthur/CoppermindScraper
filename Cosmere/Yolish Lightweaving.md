**Yolish Lightweaving** is a manifestation of [[Investiture\|Investiture]] on [[Yolen\|Yolen]] that originates prior to the [[Shattering\|Shattering]] of [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]]. All pure illusion magic is considered [[Lightweaving\|Lightweaving]].

## Abilities and Weaknesses
Yolish Lightweaving allows for the creation of optical and auditory illusions. Lightweavers can use this to make disguises, and to produce light. It could also make illusions in smoke such as making images of [[Derethil\|people]] and [[Wandersail\|ships]]. All illusion magic will work in a similar manner. Illusion magic is capable of creating auditory and visual manifestations either independent of a Lightweaver (i.e. fixed in place) or linked to a host. Both require a steady source of [[Investiture\|Investiture]]. These manifestations are linked to a person's mind and are largely a mental creation having no physical mass. They are capable of movement. However this is more complicated than a static image and requires greater mental control to function. The range of an image is limited to its proximity to a source of Investiture. As the Lightweaver moves away from an image it will begin to blur and then dissolve when its connection is broken. Increased focus on the part of a Lightweaver can increase the range but not greatly. Lightweaving would be affected by aphantasia.
Yolish Lightweaving is limited in some ways and may not always function perfectly, though Rosharan Lightweavers may be able to help them fully craft an illusion. Conversely, under certain circumstances, a Yolish Lightweaver may be able to guide a Rosharan Lightweaver's power.
Yolish Lightweaving does not require one to be bonded to a [[Spren\|spren]] to use it, though beyond that its method of [[Initiation\|Initiation]] is unknown. Gaining Rosharan Lightweaving can make Yolish Lightweaving more powerful and removes some of its limitations.
