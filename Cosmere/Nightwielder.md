## Appearance and Personality
Nightwielder is tall with short hair, and is thought by [[David Charleston\|David]] to be of Japanese descent. He is described as only being "half-there," although when he is corporeal, he looks frail. He typically has a pool of dark mist around him, although he can easily turn this mist into solid tendrils of darkness, which can be seen moving through the air.  In his full glory, Nightwielder appears to be clothed in night, with darkness writhing around him.

Nightwielder becomes corporeal whenever he has UV light shining on him. This doesn't affect the large-scale darkness. It has been theorized that this is due to him having had skin cancer at some point before he became an Epic.

## History
During the unexpected encounter in [[Diamond\|Diamond]]'s weapon shop, David confirmed his suspicion that Nightwielder's weakness is UV by pretending to have accidentally activated a UV camera. Uncertain whether this was deliberate or not, Nightwielder chose not to attack. Nightwielder was killed by [[David Charleston\|David Charleston]]'s exploitation of his weakness during the [[Reckoners\|Reckoners]]' assassination of Steelheart.
