**Bronze** is the internal mental pushing metal. An Allomancer burning bronze is able to detect the presence of Allomancy being used nearby, sounding like drum beats to the Seeker's ears. Feruchemists can use bronze to store wakefulness, and when used as a Hemalurgic spike, bronze steals Mental Allomantic powers.
Bronze is the alloy paired with [[Copper\|copper]] in the Metallic Arts.

## Allomantic Use
A bronze [[Misting\|Misting]] is known as a **Seeker**. When a Seeker burns bronze, they are able to detect nearby use of Allomancy or Feruchemy, or any form of [[Investiture\| Kinetic Investiture]]. The Seeker feels pulses, like beats of a drum, emanating from the person burning a metal. The metals are grouped into fast (external) and slow (internal), pushing and pulling, and have their own signature pattern (Physical, Mental, Temporal, and Enhancement). This is how it is known that bronze is a Pushing metal, while copper is Pulling.
It is easier to sense an Allomancer flaring their metal. A talented Seeker can detect which parts of a person’s emotions a [[Soother\|Soother]] or [[Rioter\|Rioter]] intends to inﬂuence, and who they are targeting. They could also tell when someone is ﬂaring their metal or when they’re running low on metals.
The pulses detected by a Seeker are related to the [[Rhythm\|tone]] of [[Preservation\|Preservation]]. If a [[Singer\|singer]] were to become a Seeker or Mistborn, they'd find bronze pulses familiar, though strange.
It is possible for a skilled enough Seeker to detect the use of Feruchemy, although this is a skill that only the rarest of practitioners have access to. The reason for this is due to Feruchemy being far more internal than Allomancy, and therefore the pulses are harder to detect and read, and it requires a special tweak in order to do so.

### Savantism
If someone were able to burn the amount of bronze needed to become an Allomantic [[Savant\|savant]] with the metal, their range would be expanded and they might be able to pierce [[Copper\|copperclouds]] depending on their relative strength. A savant would also be able to tell the difference between regular Allomancy and [[Compounding\|Compounding]]. Due to Seekers' tendency to constantly burn bronze, many have become savants unknowingly.

### Detecting Investiture
It is theoretically possible for bronze Allomancy to detect any kinetic [[Investiture\|Investiture]], though it has trouble finding inactive wells of power.
Bronze can detect:

[[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]], including being able differentiate between [[Surge\|Surges]]
[[AonDor\|AonDor]]
[[Awakening\|Awakening]]
The Rhythms of [[Roshar\|Roshar]]
Shardblades when summoned
## Feruchemical Use
A bronze [[Ferring\|Ferring]] is known as a **Sentry**. Bronze is used to store wakefulness. It allows the Sentry to stay awake for extended periods of time, or to heighten awareness. A Sentry filling a bronzemind becomes drowsy, and may sleep in a coma-like trance. It is the only type of metalmind a Feruchemist can store into while sleeping. Caffeine can be used to generate extra wakefulness, but it would feel different upon being tapped.

### Compounding
A bronze [[Compounding\|Compounder]] would be able to use bronze to have a nearly infinite supply of a good night's sleep, and therefore would never need to sleep.

## Hemalurgic Use
When used as a Hemalurgic spike, bronze steals Mental Allomantic powers ([[Zinc\|zinc]], [[Brass\|brass]], [[Copper\|copper]], and bronze).

## Fabrial Use
A [[Fabrial\|fabrial]] with a bronze cage will create a warning fabrial.
