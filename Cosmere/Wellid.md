## Appearance and Personality
Wellid's mind wanders, and he is not particularly invested in the Set's overall mission. He does not like sailing; the height of the ship's deck above the ocean surface and the crashing of the waves discomfort him. His decision to be part of the [[Pewternaut\|Pewternaut]] A16's crew is predicated on the idea that a warship would be the safest place for him during the conflict between [[Bilming\|Bilming]] and [[Elendel\|Elendel]], as he does not know that it is meant to be a suicide mission. As such, he is not the zealot that his fellow crew members are.

## History
>“*Damn. I meant for him to find a lifeboat or somethin'.*”
\-Wayne after Wellid jumps overboard[2]

In 348 [[Catacendre\|PC]], Wellid volunteered to be part of the crew that sailed the Pewternaut A16 from Bilming to Elendel. After a briefing, he was given a lantern and told to keep watch on the deck. Wellid was disturbed by the mists and strange sounds that he heard; opening his lantern in order to look down at the waters, he attracted [[Gabria\|Gabria's]] attention and was rebuked by her. Shortly afterwards, [[Wax\|Wax]] and [[Wayne\|Wayne]] climbed onto the deck in front of him. Wax pointed [[Vindication\|Vindication]] at him and interrogated him about the bomb's location. Wayne told him to get off the boat, so Wellid immediately threw himself overboard. He was wearing a life jacket, but it is unknown whether he survived.

## Trivia
As a descendant of [[Wellen\|Wellen]], Wellid is another cameo for [[Dan Wells\|Dan Wells]].
