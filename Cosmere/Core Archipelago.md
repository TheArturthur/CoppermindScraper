The **Core Archipelago** is an island chain in the [[Emerald Sea\|Emerald Sea]] on [[Lumar\|Lumar]]. It is the home of the [[Verdant King\|Verdant King]], who lives in a palace on one of the islands, presumably in the city of [[Kingsport\|Kingsport]].

## Geography
The archipelago is a good distance from [[Shimmerbay\|Shimmerbay]] and far from [[Diggen's Point\|Diggen's Point]]. The number of islands and their size are both unknown, but [[Huck\|Huck]] implies that some islands are as large as forty miles wide.

## History
The [[Charlie's father\|duke]] of Diggen's Point would periodically visit the king to report on his territory. A "cursed" [[Hoid\|Hoid]] claimed to have visited the archipelago during his time on Lumar.
The archipelago was the claimed destination of the *Oot's Dream* after it forged a king's writ to buy six kegs of [[Brick\|Brick's]] ale on Diggen's Point. [[Tress\|Tress]] posed as a royal inspector hoping to gain passage to the king's island on the ship as part of her plan to free [[Charlie\|Charlie]].
