**Camon** is a [[Skaa\|skaa]] from [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].

## Appearance and Personality
Camon is stout, with stubby fingers, a pudgy face, and a tendency to drink. He is extremely arrogant, as well as tyrannical, though this is more likely due to the nature of his [[Skaa\|skaa]] underground rather than his own personality. He leads a prominent thieving crew in [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]] that includes many skaa where they scam people and [[Canton\|Cantons]]. He is likely aware of [[Vin\|Vin's]] ability to use [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]], although it is unknown whether he knew she was [[Mistborn\|Mistborn]] or he just believed her to be a [[Soother\|Soother]]. He exploits this by making her unknowingly Soothe people so they're easier to scam.
Camon is very is one of the best [[Noble\|noble]] impersonators in the Luthadel underground, he has his team impersonate skaa slaves, servants, and nobles to sell the scam.

## History
He was the leader of a [[Camon's crew\|thief crew]] that [[Vin\|Vin]] worked with.
About six years before the [[Collapse\|Collapse]], [[Theron\|Theron]], a leader of a thieving crew, discovered that the [[Steel Ministry\|Steel Ministry]] secretly moved a large amount of funds to [[Luthadel\|Luthadel]] along with acolytes transferring to Luthadel for their final instruction. Over the next five years, he spent thousands of [[Boxing\|boxings]] to create the perfect opportunity to steal these funds, creating the appearance that House Jedue was financially desperate. This included faking contracts for House Jedue to "loose," such as the **Farwan** deal, the "loss" of which made it appear as if House Jedue could no long afford to run its canal boats to Luthadel. This appearance, in turn, allowed him to apply for a contract with the [[Canton of Finance\|Canton of Finance]] to run the canal boats that transported the acolytes, and make the offer extremely appealing by offering a significantly reduced price without it appearing suspicious.
To sell the con, however, Theron needed someone to play the role of Lord Jedue, and so reluctantly partnered with Camon. Camon played along, but he knew Theron's resources were stretched thin. After securing the contract, Camon betrayed Theron and simply took the three thousand boxing down payment, abandoning the plan to actual run the boats and steel from the convoy, and leaving Theron to deal with the Ministry's wrath when it discovered it had been scammed.
During the scam Vin used [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]] on an [[Obligator\|obligator]] in the Canton of Finance, [[Bendal\|an Inquisitor]] was set on his trail. As punishment for his cruelty to Vin, he is ousted by [[Kelsier\|Kelsier]] and becomes a beggar. He is later killed by the Inquisitor to send a warning to [[Kelsier's crew\|Kelsier's crew]].
