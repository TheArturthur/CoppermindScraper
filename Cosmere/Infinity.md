She is an acquaintance of [[Mizzy\|Mizzy's]] and attends the [[Party in Babilar\|party in Babilar]] with [[Marco (Reckoners)\|Marco]], [[Lulu\|Lulu]], and [[Calaka\|Calaka]]. She attempts to spray [[David\|David]] with paint to help him fit in at the party, but he nervously overreacts, jumping away from her.
Mizzy asks the group about a mutual friend named [[Steve\|Steve]]. Infinity believes that he was one of the eighty people killed in a recent attack by [[Obliteration\|Obliteration]], but she and Marco quickly change the subject to the quality of [[Edso\|Edso's]] party music. David is stunned by both the apathy of the Babilarans and their disdain for the [[Reckoners\|Reckoners]] and anyone else who tries to fight Epics.
