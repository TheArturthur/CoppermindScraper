**Dwookim** is a [[Torish\|Torish]] [[Yoki-hijo\|yoki-hijo]] who was very active in the [[Reform movement\|reform movement]] prior to her retirement.
As a reformed yoki-hijo, she often ate, bathed, and made other decisions for herself. Late in her career, Dwookim worked only about half the days of any given week, taking the other days off for rest or other personal reasons. When working, she summoned an average of roughly ten [[Hijo\|hijo]] in a session. She eventually retired, presumably at or by the age of seventy. [[Hwanji\|Hwanji]] worked as one of Dwookim's attendants for several years.
