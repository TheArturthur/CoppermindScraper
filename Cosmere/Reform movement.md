The **reform movement** is a popular shift in philosophies concerning the autonomy expected of the [[Yoki-hijo\|yoki-hijo]] in [[Torio\|Torio]], following a **schism** between those with more liberal opinions and those with traditional, orthodox beliefs on the matter. The schism occurred a few hundred years prior to the activation of the [[Machine\|machine]], and most yoki-hijo are adherents to the movement during Yumi's tenure.
Adherents of the reform movement often eat, bathe, and make other decisions for themselves. They are also known to take days off working for rest or other personal reasons, and insist on retiring at the age of seventy. Opposers of the movement believe that there is danger in abandoning their traditions, and view the more liberal attitude as weak and petulant. Orthodox wardens withhold information about the movement from their yoki-hijo.
