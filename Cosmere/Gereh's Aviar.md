## Appearance and Personality
Gereh's Aviar is bright red on its head and body; its wings are a bright blue that fades to red toward the tips. It stands about a foot tall.
The Aviar is extremely loyal to Gereh and insists on returning to him. It quickly discerns that Lift's intentions are friendly and accepts her help calmly and readily.

## Attributes and Abilities
Gereh's Aviar has mind abilities. However, this talent is unknown, and it is possible that it has been affected in some way by its travel to Roshar. The bird is highly intelligent and has a sense of the location of the person to whom it is bonded. It can to a certain extent both understand and communicate with humans.

## History
Gereh's Aviar originated from [[First of the Sun\|First of the Sun]]. [[Gereh\|Gereh]] either had not obtained it yet or did not keep it with him commonly during his duties as a steward in [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]]; however, by 1175 he did have it with him at [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]]. During the pair's stay there, [[Mraize\|Mraize]] murdered Gereh for unknown reasons. Mraize's own Aviar then attempted to kill Gereh's Aviar, badly wounding it. [[Lift\|Lift]] defended Gereh's Aviar and healed it with [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]], saving its life. The Aviar then guided her through Urithiru down to Gereh's corpse. It mourned over its loss until Mraize and his Aviar entered the room, at which point Lift fled with Gereh's Aviar. During Lift's capture and imprisonment, she lost track of the Aviar; she began looking for it again immediately upon her release. By the time the occupation of the tower ended, Lift had managed to reconnect with the Aviar, and she and [[Wyndle\|Wyndle]] took it in.
