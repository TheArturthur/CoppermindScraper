## Synopsis
*Spensa’s world has been under attack for decades. Now pilots are the heroes of what's left of the human race, and becoming one has always been Spensa's dream. Since she was a little girl, she has imagined soaring skyward and proving her bravery. But her fate is intertwined with her father's- a pilot himself who was killed years ago when he abruptly deserted his team, leaving Spensa the daughter of a coward, her chances of attending Flight School slim to none.*
*No one will let Spensa forget what her father did, yet fate works in mysterious ways. Flight School might be a long shot, but she is determined to fly. And an accidental discovery in a long-forgotten cavern might just provide her with a way to claim the stars.*

[[Spensa\|Spensa]] has dreamed of being a pilot since she was a child. Inspired by her father, then fueled with outrage by the [[DDF\|DDF's]] accusations of cowardice following his death, Spensa spends the next decade preparing for the [[Flight school\|flight school]] entrance exam. Gaining entrance to the program with the help of her new instructor [[Cobb\|Cobb]], Spensa teams up with nine fellow trainees to form [[Skyward Flight\|Skyward Flight]] and battle the [[KRELL\|Krell]], an alien force trying to destroy the [[Defiant League\|Defiant]] colony. Aided by the mysterious stealth fighter [[M-Bot\|M-Bot]], whom she finds abandoned in a cave, Spensa must navigate the pitfalls of flight school, uncover the truth about her father's death, and try not to die at the hands of an enemy starfighter.

## Main Characters

## Setting
Skyward is a non-[[Cosmere\|cosmere]] novel set in the [[Cytoverse\|Cytoverse]] on the planet [[Detritus\|Detritus]].

## Development
Brandon wrote Skyward in approximately three months, most of that while he was on tour for Oathbringer or on holiday.
Brandon's premise for the story was "How to Train Your Dragon but instead it's a girl who finds a spaceship and goes to Top Gun school. It's like a mashup between Top Gun and Ender's Game and How to Train Your Dragon with an old broken-down spaceship with a really weird personality."
