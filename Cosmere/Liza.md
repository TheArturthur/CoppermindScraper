**Liza** is a coroner living in America.
She is in her late fifties. She is very tall. She likes to be called a medical examiner. She constantly plays games while on duty. She has difficulty interacting with people and so finds a job as a coroner to be satisfactory. She does not enjoy paperwork or meetings. [[Tobias\|Tobias]] adores her but Stephen doesn't know what Tobias saw in her.
While [[Stephen Leeds\|Stephen]] was investigating the disappearance of [[Panos Maheras\|Panos Maheras]]' body, he talked to Liza in order to try and find clues. She wore a white lab coat over jeans and a pink buttoned blouse. She describes herself as busy to avoid helping Stephen but was playing games. Liza was curious about the disappearance because the commissioner had insisted the body was to stay in the morgue until it was stolen. Liza agreed to trade an interview between Stephen and a psychologist for 15 minutes of looking around the morgue.
