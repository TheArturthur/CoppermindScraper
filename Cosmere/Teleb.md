## Appearance and Personality
Teleb is tall, straight-backed, and has light green eyes. Well-muscled in his arms and shoulders, he has long hair that he wears in a braid and a blue tattoo on his cheek that marks him as an [[Oldblood\|Oldblood]]. He is married to [[Kalami\|Kalami]]. He is as literal as rocks and also tends to keep his opinions to himself.

## Attributes and Abilities
Teleb is a highly skilled archer, able to consistently hit targets from around four hundred yards. He is also proficient in wearing [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]] and wielding a [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]].

[[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] recruited Teleb into his [[Dalinar's elites\|elites]] when he attacked Teleb's home in 1140. Assigned by his brightlord [[Yezriar\|Yezriar]] to assassinate the [[Highprince\|highprince]], Teleb shot Dalinar with an arrow from nearly four hundred yards away. Dalinar was impressed by this feat and promptly gave him the choice of joining his army, to which Teleb reluctantly agreed in exchange for sparing his town from pillaging.
During the first assault at [[Rathalas\|Rathalas]], Teleb proved his worth by shooting the soldiers that were trying to drop Dalinar in the Rift by cutting the bridge from under him. At a dinner when [[Gavilar\|Gavilar]] was trying to convince [[Toh\|Toh]] that the [[Alethi\|Alethi]] were strong enough to protect him and his sister, Dalinar made the point for him by walking over to another bunker in the midst of a [[Highstorm\|highstorm]] to ask Teleb if he still had Dalinar's favorite knife. Dalinar grew to regard Teleb highly enough that he was given use of [[Adolin\|Adolin's]] [[Shardplate\|Plate]], the Shards that Toh and [[Evi\|Evi]] had brought with them as a bargaining chip, until Adolin was old enough to use the Plate himself. A few years later, the next time the army was attacking the Rift, Teleb was in charge of directing the army and assigned a group of scouts to tail a large caravan that had just left Rathalas. When Dalinar went to investigate [[Tanalan\|Tanalan's]] report that the caravan included an Alethi highprince, he left Teleb in charge of the army in his absence. Teleb sent another team of scouts after Dalinar as soon as Tanalan turned on the Alethi forces, and the team reported that Dalinar's group had been ambushed and killed. Assuming Dalinar was dead, he then began planning for a siege to allow Gavilar time to arrive and seek vengeance on his brother's death. Upon Dalinar's arrival back at the camp, Teleb obeyed orders to have the scouts imprisoned and to set the army's [[Soulcaster\|Soulcaster]] to making oil. Teleb tried to talk Dalinar out of burning the city, but not very strongly, and he was disregarded.
In the [[Warcamp\|warcamps]] during the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]], he was Dalinar's highofficer on duty when a [[Chasmfiend\|chasmfiend]] was detected crawling up on a plateau only two hours away. When Dalinar decided to march, he had Teleb send for Adolin.
Teleb discussed using man-carried bridges with Dalinar, who was opposed to the idea. Knowing Dalinar's opinion, he suggested using them to reach a contested plateau faster but not for the assault itself. Though Dalinar was hesitant, he knew the value of listening to a highly-regarded officer's advice, and he told Teleb he could train one bridge crew for the purpose of testing the idea. Because [[Chull\|chull]]-drawn bridges would be needed for the assault, Teleb tried to design a new kind of bridge; his first attempt failed because the bridge didn't stand the weight of the chulls.
As Dalinar returned from the [[Battle of the Tower\|Battle of the Tower]], he sent a message to Teleb that he should bring the entire camp to alert and mobilize the remaining soldiers, preparing for anything. At a later point, Adolin gave Teleb use of the Plate he won from his duel with [[Eranniv\|Eranniv]], which he subsequently painted silver and wielded along with a [[Shardhammer\|Shardhammer]].

>“*Brightlord Teleb has fallen! Highprince Roion has been routed. His lines are broken, his remaining men surrounded by Parshendi!*”
\-News of Teleb's death reaching Dalinar[1]

Teleb served in his position as Highlord on the expedition to find [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]]. He alerted Dalinar to [[Rlain\|Rlain's]] approach, though Rlain refused to speak to him and only answered Dalinar's questions. Teleb was given command of [[Sebarial\|Sebarial's]] army during the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]], but he died in the conflict while supporting [[Roion\|Roion's]] troops. The King's [[Shardblade\|Blade]] he was wielding was recovered by [[Captain Khal\|Captain Khal]], although his Plate was lost.
During the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]], [[Odium\|Odium]] brought up Dalinar's memory of killing Yezriar as part of his attempt to make Dalinar give in to him. Seemingly this was because Dalinar's high regard for Teleb caused him to realize Yezriar must have been a very good man to hold Teleb's loyalty.

## Trivia
Teleb's character has several similarities to , one of the great generals of the Mongol army during the 1200s. These include that Jebe, as an enemy of Genghis Khan, shot him in the neck. After being brought to Genghis, he promised to serve him loyally.
