This page or section needs to be updated with new informationÂ for *The Lost Metal*!Be aware that in its current state, it may not include all additional content yet.

**Bendalloy** is the External Temporal Pushing metal. An Allomancer burning bendalloy is able to squeeze time in a bubble around them, making it pass more quickly. Feruchemists can use bendalloy to store nutritional energy, and when used as a Hemalurgic spike, bendalloy steals Spiritual Feruchemical powers. It is an alloy of [[Cadmium\|cadmium]] and bismuth, the alloy paired with cadmium in the Metallic Arts.
Bendalloy is expensive, with one nugget costing around five hundred notes.

## Allomantic Use
A bendalloy [[Misting\|Misting]] is known as a **Slider**. Burning bendalloy pushes on time around the user, causing time to pass more quickly in a bubble around them. Events outside the bubble appear to move much slower to someone inside.
When a bendalloy bubble and a [[Cadmium\|cadmium]] bubble occur in the same place, their effects cancel out resulting in no change whilst still burning the metals used. The time bubble created by a Slider is approximately five to fifteen feet across and is smaller than that possible while burning cadmium. Careful examination may reveal the edge of the bubble, where air appears to shimmer. As long as some part of a person is inside the speed bubble, they will be included in its effect.
When a time bubble is created, the area of the bubble stays stationary relative to a moving object as long as the Slider creating it is stationed on an object large enough. For example, someone standing on a planet, which is quite massive, is still actually moving with the rotation of the planet, and the bubble moves with that person, but the bubble itself stays in the same place relative to the planet. However, if the Slider who created a time bubble is on a small, moving object (or the person merely walks to the edge of the bubble), the Slider will be transported through the bubble, "popping" it. Objects entering or exiting the bubble are thrown wildly off-course, most likely because different parts of the object are moving at different speeds during the transition. When leaving the bubble, time bubbles interfere with almost all forms of [[Investiture\|Investiture]]. However, they do not interfere with emotional allomancy. When multiple bubbles occur in the same space their effects are multiplied, as it speeds up the already sped up time.
The amount of Investiture required is proportional to the size of the bubble and the factor of compression.
If a Slider flares bendalloy when forming a time bubble, time inside the bubble is sped up to a great degree, likely related to a larger amount of Investiture being used at one time, therefore leading to an increase in the compression factor. The size and speed of the bubble is pretty much determined when it's first formed, except more skilled users can actively change the size and shape, and reduce the interval between the creation of new bubbles. When one ingests a very large amount of bendalloy and burns [[Duralumin\|duralumin]], time is sped up by an extreme degree, and the bubble appears to solidify like crystal, and cracks as it fades. Light appears to act strangely outside of the bubble.
Bendalloy is involved in the process of Allomantic faster-than-light travel.
A speed bubble can be popped by [[Aluminum\|aluminum]].

### Savantism
If someone were able to burn the amount of bendalloy needed to become an Allomantic [[Savant\|savant]] with the metal, they would be able to anchor the speed bubble to themselves, allowing the speed bubble to move with them. This would cause complications for objects moving in and out of the bubble as energy is transferred to and from the [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual Realm]] to prevent redshift and blueshift. They would also be able to influence the size of the bubble and the amount of time it gives.

## Feruchemical Use
A bendalloy [[Ferring\|Ferring]] is known as a **Subsumer**. Bendalloy is used to store nutrition and calories. While filling a bendalloymind, a Subsumer is able to eat large quantities of food without becoming full. Tapping such a metalmind will allow the user to go without food. A separate bendalloymind can be used to store fluid intake.

### Compounding
A bendalloy [[Compounding\|Compounder]] would be able to use bendalloy to survive without food or water.

## Hemalurgic Use
When used as a Hemalurgic spike, bendalloy steals Spiritual Feruchemical powers ([[Chromium\|chromium]], [[Nicrosil\|nicrosil]], [[Aluminum\|aluminum]], and [[Duralumin\|duralumin]]).

## History
During the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]], [[Cadmium\|cadmium]] and bendalloy were inaccessible and unknown to Allomancers, though they were possibly known to the [[Lord Ruler\|Lord Ruler]]. The fact that their technology couldn't create the metals made Mistings of these types impossible to discover. After the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]], advancement in technology eventually made the metals available.

## Trivia
In an original mockup of the complete Table of Allomantic Metals, this metal was named cerrobend. However, the word cerrobend was a trademarked name for , and so [[Brandon\|Brandon]] was forced to use bendalloy instead.
The original plans for bendalloy and cadmium involved redshifting or blueshifting of light passing through the bubble. But this was dropped as it would have lead to people outside being microwaved and blasted with radiation. This was solved through the transfer of energy between the Physical and Spiritual Realms.
The real world alloy for bendalloy is 50% bismuth, 26.7% lead, 13.3% tin, and 10% cadmium. This is supported in-world by it being called an alloy of bismuth and cadmium.
The time dilation effect of bendalloy was originally defined as compressing 2 minutes of time into 15 seconds without flaring the metal. This was changed with the leatherbound release of Alloy of Law to leave the exact compression ratio to be ambiguous.
