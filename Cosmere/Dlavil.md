## History
>“*She knows our secrets. She knows this base. She saw what you and Moonlight can do. She glimpsed the maps, the powers, the knowledge. She is dangerous to us now.*”
\-Dlavil to TwinSoul[1]

Dlavil was stationed in [[Elendel\|Elendel]], and likely helped with the city's evacuation when it was threatened by [[Autonomy\|Autonomy's]] agents, per [[Kelsier\|Kelsier's]] orders. Ten hours after the [[Set\|Set's]] bomb detonated, Dlavil was inside the Ghostbloods' Elendel safehouse with Kelsier and several other Ghostbloods. When [[Marasi Colms\|Marasi Colms]] refused Kelsier's offer to join their ranks, Dlavil advocated for silencing her. He argued that she knew too much to be left to her own devices, but [[TwinSoul\|TwinSoul]] and Kelsier disagreed. Kelsier ordered Dlavil to not act against Marasi or anyone else in Elendel without his order.
