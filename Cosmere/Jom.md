**Jom** is a cobbler in [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]].
He broke his arm before the [[Siege of Kholinar\|Siege of Kholinar]].
[[Grund\|Grund]] knew of Jom, and suggested to [[Shallan Davar\|Veil]] that Jom would be a good candidate to give extra food to, along with many other candidates. However, the [[Grips\|Grips]] killed all of Grund's friends for the food and terrorized anyone who received food, so it is possible Jom is now dead.
