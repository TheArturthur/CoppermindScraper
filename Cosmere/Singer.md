>“*The betrayal of spren has brought us here.They gave their Surges to human heirs,But not to those who know them most dear, before us.’Tis no surprise we turned awayUnto the gods we spent our daysAnd to become their molding clay, they changed us.*”
\-Song of Secrets, 40th Stanza[1]


The **singers** are the most common and widespread sapient species on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. The Alethi refer to them as **parsh** or **parshmen**. They are native Rosharan lifeforms characterized by their bipedalism, carapace, high intelligence, tetramorphic sexual paradigm, and the presence of a gemheart they can use to create symbiotic bonds with spren, which has a significant impact on both their biology and cognition. They are highly social animals capable of forming complex social structures and civilizations, with complex institutions defining their social interactions.
They are descended from the ancient [[Dawnsingers\|Dawnsingers]] who first inhabited ancient Roshar before the [[Shattering of Adonalsium\|Shattering of Adonalsium]], first emerging upon their creation over ten-thousand years prior to the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]]. The level of biological similarity they have with their ancestors is unclear.
Singers predate the humans as inhabitants of Roshar. Around the time of the [[Recreance\|Recreance]], many of the singers had their [[Connection\|Connection]] and [[Identity\|Identity]] stolen, pieces of their souls ripped away. This made those singers docile and subservient, which humans called parshmen and enslaved for millennia after. With the advent of the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]], these singers were healed and restored.

## Etymology and definition
*Singer* and *listener* are the translations of what the singers call themselves in their own respective languages, [[Dawnchant\|Dawnchant]] and *Listener*, both in the Dawnate language family. *Singer* technically does not refer to the entire species, with the species name being currently unknown. *Listener* refers specifically to the singers which, at some point prior to the [[Recreance\|Recreance]], turned away from Odium and abandoned their [[Regal\|Regal]] forms and chose to settle on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]].
Etymologically, *Singer* refers to their singing of the Rhythms of Roshar, and is likely derived from *Dawnsinger*.
To the Alethi, they are known as the *Parshendi*, translating to *Parshmen who can think*, referring to their high cognitive capacity compared to [[Slaveform\|slaveforms]] kept as slaves by humans.

## Evolution
Singers did not evolve naturally, but were instead intentionally created by [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]] some time prior to its Shattering. It is unknown how much modern singers differ from their distant ancestors.
They were created as an essential part of the Rosharan ecosystem, to what effect is unknown. They were also intentionally made to be able to breed with humans.

## Biology and Appearance
  A femalen singer
Singers are humanoid, but not entirely similar to *Homo sapiens*, differing in various notable aspects.
They are bipedal, and posses a foramen magnum at the base of the skull; they also have a large intracranial space, comparable to *Homo sapiens*. This, alongside a presumably well-developed cerebrum, gives them a high cognitive capacity. It is unclear how prominent of a supraorbital ridge they possess, if any. They have a protruding nasus very similar to that of humans.
They have greater resistance to cold temperatures than humans.

### Aging and Senescence
Apart from their polychromatic skin, singers have other features that differentiate them from humans. They grow at a faster rate than humans and have slightly shorter average lifespans. In the [[Listener\|listeners']] culture, [[Venli\|Venli]] started to learn about singing as a keeper of songs at age three and is considered adult at age ten.
Their epidermal marbling whitening at the edges is a sign of age and senescence. Furthermore, elderly singers can experience cognitive decline, memory loss, and difficulty developing new memories. Dullform experiences rapid degradation in mental faculties as one ages, Singer children are born in dullform, and do not experience the normal cognitive impairments of dullform in adult singers. By around seven or eight Rosharan years, cognitive decline begins to manifest, forcing young singers to take on a different form.

### Carapace
Their bodies have red-orange carapace growing over various parts of their body; where and how much depends on what form the singer is currently in, but they typically cover the cranium and the upper extremities. Their carapace is held on to their body by a series of blue ligaments, suggesting the lack of an epidermis under their carapace.
The amount of carapace and where it forms is dependent on the form the singer is in, for example, in warform it manifests as armor-like plating across the entire body; this carapace armor is designed not only to grant greater protection to the singer, but also to trap air and push it up underneath to cool them. On the other hand, nimbleform entirely lacks carapace.

### Circulatory System
Singers have orange blood. They possess a heart which pumps blood through their body in a closed circulatory system.

### Endoskeleton
Their endoskeletons are made up of red-coloured bones. They are known to possess a sternum, which is fused with their gemheart. Within the bone is a white marrow-like substance.

### Epidermis and Epidermal Marblings
The most apparent sign of their non-human nature is the epidermis; it is covered in marblings, swirls of various colors - red, black or white. Most singers have dichromatic epidermides, either red-black or red-white; these marblings can manifest in various way, both as delicate swirls and large, wind-swept patterns. There are singers whose skin is trichromatic, but they are extremely rare relative to the dichromatic phenotype. The color whitening at the edges is a sign of age and senescence. Their hair is typically orange or red -- colors that do not appear to occur naturally in Rosharan humans, outside of those with partial singer genetic admixture. There is a relationship between the color of singer hair and their individual marbling colors.

### Extremities
They possess four limbs, made up of two upper and two lower extremities. Their upper extremities end with five-digit hands, and their lower extremities end with five-digit feet.

### Gemhearts
Like many local species in the Rosharan biosphere, singers possess [[Gemheart\|gemhearts]], though theirs have a cloudy white coloration, and are fused to and grown into their sternum. Those gemhearts allow them to bond with [[Spren\|spren]], letting them change their **forms**, leading to a change in both appearance and some mental faculty. Due to their gemhearts, singers do not leak [[Lights\|Lights]] like humans do.
The gemheart forms due to the internal chemical workings of the body, which uses the nutrients and chemicals present in crem in order to form the gemheart.

### Height
Due to Roshar's relatively low gravity, they are relatively tall compared to humans from other planets, averaging at over six feet (1.83 metres). Their height varies between forms, with forms such as Warform being taller and bulkier than other forms, and with envoyform being even taller than warform and Alethi humans.

### Mandible and Molar Structure
Their teeth are built differently than human teeth; their back molars allow them to chew through shells, their dental formula is unknown, but is likely divergent from the dental formula of *homo sapiens*. Their ability to crush shells is further assisted by a divergent mandible structure, with several bones not present in human mandibles, situated near the back of the structure.

### Metabolism and Diet
Their metabolism is geared towards metabolizing shells, which their jaw structure helps them to crush, allowing them to make better use of the local fauna.
Singers can drink crem without getting sick.

### Ocular Structure
They have two eyes set in orbital cavities. They are divergent from the eyes of *homo sapiens* - with black sclerae and no visible iris, giving them an all-black appearance.

### Sexes and reproduction
Singers possess four distinct sexes; male and female, which are capable of reproduction, and their neutered variants, **malen** and **femalen**. Singers' sex will change from between male and malen, or female and femalen, as they change forms; the vast majority of forms are either malen or femalen. As such, most singers are asexual the vast majority of the time. Singers usually identify as one of those four genders as well, though some identify with a non-quaternary gender and singer culture recognizes at least one non-quaternary gender.
Singers cannot switch between male and female or malen and femalen by biological means, though it is possible to do so through Invested means. Their sex-determination system is unknown, and following from the inability to switch between male and female, ultimately decides between two sexes, despite their tetramorphism.


#### Interspecies Breeding and Introgression
Despite these genotypical and phenotypical differences, singers and humans are capable of cross-breeding; the [[Herdazian\|Herdazians]] and [[Unkalaki\|Unkalaki]] are notable examples of human ethnicities with singer ancestry, although they experienced a heavy degree of introgression. This ancestry is the source of the Herdazians' stone-like nails as well as the Unkalaki's shell-chewing teeth and red hair. As a result of their singer ancestry, Herdazians and Unkalaki are also more likely to identify as asexual. It's unknown whether there are currently any people with both human and singer ancestry who identify as singers.
They do not share a common ancestor, though can interbreed due to the similar intent behind their creation.

#### Sexual Tetramorphism
Sexual tetramorphism is minimal in asexual forms, enough so that it is easy to misidentify the sex of a singer. The presence of facial hair on male and malen singers is one mark of sexual dimorphism present in malen and femalen forms. Female individuals, particularly those in mateform, have prominent breasts which are less notable in femalen individuals.

### Spiritual Aspects
Despite these biological differences, singers are like humans in many [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual]] aspects. Like humans, they can receive boons and curses from the [[Nightwatcher\|Nightwatcher]]. They can also bond [[Spren\|spren]] to attain [[Knights Radiant\|Radiant]] powers, though most spren are unwilling to reach out for such a bond. Singers can see the reality of the spren more closely than a human.

## Forms
  A femalen singer
By bonding various [[Spren\|spren]] in the [[Highstorm\|highstorm]] or [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]], Singers are capable of changing their **form**, leading to a different appearance, capabilities and even mental state, as well as changing subtly their [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual aspect]]. It is possible that the forms also alter [[Identity\|Identity]]. New forms come with a level of instinctual understanding. ​Singers can maintain their form indefinitely, without needing to resupply with [[Stormlight\|stormlight]] or [[Voidlight\|voidlight]], and can use the abilities granted by the form without needing additional fuel. New forms could exist. Certain things can stop a singer from changing forms, such as [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]].
The forms are specializations, and gear the singer towards a particular purpose; for example, warform grants armor and increased strength, making it suitable for combat, while nimbleform grants dexterity, making it good for delicate tasks. There are also more specific forms, such as artform for creative endeavours, or mateform for breeding. Aside from dullform, every form is associated with a specific type of spren. Ordinarily, what spren a singer will bond -- and thus what form they'll assume -- depends on their mindset during the highstorm. However, capturing a spren in a gemstone and bringing it into the storm all but ensures that a specific form will be selected. Bonding to a [[Sja-anat\|corrupted]] spren will give different results.
When changing forms, a singer may temporarily not be able to hear certain rhythms, or hear pure tones.
[[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgy]] could also be used to replicate the transformation of the forms.
[[Listener\|Listeners]] recounted many common forms in the [[Song of Listing\|Song of Listing]]; they also have songs speaking of [[Regal\|forms of power]] -- the [[Song of Secrets\|Song of Secrets]] and the [[Song of Winds\|Song of Winds]].

### Known common forms
These forms are mentioned in the listener [[Song of Listing\|Song of Listing]]. After the [[Recreance\|Recreance]] and before the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], when the only singers who could think clearly were the [[Listener\|listeners]], the listeners only discovered five forms: dullform, mateform, warform, workform, and nimbleform. When the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]] arrived and healed the other singers, singers held these forms and other common forms the listeners could not reproduce, such as artform and scholarform, and had a "dozen" options.

#### Dullform
 
>“* Dullform dread, with the mind most lost.The lowest, and one not bright.To find this form, one needs banish cost.It finds you and brings you to blight.*”
\- final stanza of the Song of Listing[63]


Dullform occurs when a singer bonds an incorrect [[Spren\|spren]], or a spren that does not grant any other form. It's physically similar to the "slaveform" of the parshmen, to the point where a dullform singer can easily pass for one. It is also mentally limiting; those in dullform find thinking difficult, as if they were half-asleep, and have a harder time hearing the [[Rhythm\|rhythms]].
Dullform was one of the two forms the [[Last Legion\|Last Legion]] was left with after breaking away from the rest of the singers, alongside mateform. It was largely abandoned as other forms were rediscovered. However, [[Listener\|listener]] spies still used it when infiltrating the human warcamps, thanks to its similarity to slaveform.
Singer children are born in dullform, though for them, it is more vibrant and less cloudy; a property it loses as the singer ages. The listeners call this subtype of dullform "childform". They need to take another form around the age of seven or eight.


#### Mateform
 
>“* Mateform meek, for love to share,Given to life, it brings us joy.To find this form, one must care.True empathy, one must employ.*”
\- 5th stanza of the Song of Listing[64]


Mateform is used by singers to reproduce; though the other forms are capable of having children, mateform is the one most specialized for the purpose. In female singers, entering mateform increases the size of their breasts; it's unknown what physical effect it has on male singers. Mentally, mateform causes a singer to behave irresponsibly and become distracted in favour of the form's primary purpose; mateforms will sometimes ignore their assigned task, or do things that are expressly forbidden, without realizing the issue with that. Some singers are, however, capable of keeping themselves together while in mateform, though this requires strong mental discipline. Singers in mateform are bonded with [[/wiki/Spren#Lifespren]].
It was one of the original forms the [[Last Legion\|Last Legion]] had after abandoning the [[Regal\|Regal]] forms, alongside dullform. Presently, most singers assume it only transiently, when they wish to attempt having children, though there are some who keep it on at all times.


#### Warform
 
>“* Warform is worn for battle and reign,Claimed by the gods, given to kill.Unknown, unseen, but vital to gain.It comes to those with the will.*”
\- 15th stanza of the Song of Listing[65]


Warform gives listeners an armor-like carapace, and makes them taller and bulkier than other forms. The carapace armor is designed to trap air and push it up underneath to cool the singer. It grants them vastly increased strength; a singer in warform can leap over a chasm of the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] with a running start. Stamina is greatly increased, allowing singers to run for hours without strain. It also deepens their voice. Out of all the forms known to the listeners, warform requires the most food, but is also the most durable, and a warform singer heals faster than they would in any other form. Mentally, the warform has less impact than most others; it makes one more pragmatic and slightly more inclined towards violence. It also severely hampers artistic ability, and is not well-equipped to handle abstractions. Singers in warform are bonded with [[/wiki/Spren#Painspren]].
The first listeners to enter warform heard the pure tone of Honor.


#### Workform
 
>“* Workform worn for strength and care.Whispering spren breathe at your ear.Seek first this form, its mysteries to bear.Found here is freedom from fear.*”
\- 19th stanza of the Song of Listing[67]


Workform endows increased strength, though it lacks the armor; rather, singers in workform are limber and rugged. It's better suited for labor, and most workers use it; however, it is also sometimes used when fighting. Singers in workform have carapace in ridges along the backs of their hands, and no carapace on the rest of their body. They are also fairly resistant to cold weather. While in workform, singers are more obedient, and have greater difficulty committing violence, forcing one to find peaceful solutions to various problems. It's also considered more flexible than warform. Singers in workform are bonded with [[/wiki/Spren#Gravitationspren]].
The first listeners to bond workform heard the pure tone of Cultivation.


#### Nimbleform
 
>“* Nimbleform has a delicate touch.Gave the gods this form to many,Tho' once defied, by the gods they were crushed.This form craves precision and plenty.*”
\- 27th stanza of the Song of Listing[70]


Nimbleform is a general form without any singular, apparent function; rather, it's useful for all work that requires dexterity and care. For this reason, listeners use it for tasks such as research, art, and raising children. It has no carapace, and less endurance than other forms; singers in nimbleform are physically weaker, grow longer hair, and have thinner, more slender facial features. It does not impede the mind, and in fact encourages greater focus.
This form was rediscovered by the singers during the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]], through research led by [[Venli\|Venli]]. It is possible that a bond with a windspren is what allows singers to enter nimbleform. During the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], most liberated singers wore either it or workform.


#### Mediationform
>“* Mediationform made for peace, it's said.Form of teaching and consolation.When used by the gods, it became insteadForm of lies and desolation.*”
\- 33rd stanza of the Song of Listing[72]


Little is known about mediationform; it appears to bestow improved speech capabilities, or better ability to convince or bestow information upon others. Singers in mediationform have smooth, beautiful carapace, and open faces. The head researcher of the listeners, [[Venli\|Venli]], claimed that she was looking for it throughout the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]], but in reality, she never truly attempted to rediscover mediationform in the first place, instead searching for stormform.

#### Scholarform
>“* Scholarform shown for patience and thought.Beware its ambitions innate.Though study and diligence bring the reward,Loss of innocence may be one's fate.*”
\- 69th stanza of the Song of Listing[74]


Though present in the [[Song of Listing\|Song of Listing]], scholarform has only been reclaimed during the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]]; during the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]], listeners used nimbleform as a substitute. It appears to increase one's mental faculty and patience. Physically, it produces long hairstrands and angular features.

#### Artform
>“* Artform applied for beauty and hue.One yearns for the songs it creates.Most misunderstood by the artist it's true,Come the spren to foundation's fates.*”
\-90th stanza of the Song of Listing[75]


>“* Artform for colors beyond our ken;For its grand songs we yearn.We must attract creationspren;These songs suffice 'til we learn.*”
\-279th stanza of the Song of Revision[76]


Artform is formed by bonding [[Creationspren\|creationspren]]; as its name implies, it specializes in artistic expression, such as painting or music. Venli claimed to be researching this form to other listeners, though that was most likely a lie. It has not been discovered during the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]], but rather returned to the singers through the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]].

### Forms of Power
  A singer in <<Stormform\|stormform>>
>“*Qualify yourselves for greater service, and you will be elevated to the place of a Regal, given a form of power.*”
\-Fused propaganda[68]


Forms of power are attained by bonding a [[Voidspren\|voidspren]] rather than an ordinary spren. Within Odium's army, such singers are referred to as [[Regal\|Regals]]. In contrast to common forms, forms of power bestow explicitly supernatural abilities, such as being able to shoot lightning from one's fingers or speak any language in the world. They can drastically alter one's ways of thinking, such as making people more selfish and callous, and can feel intoxicating. They allow singers to hear and use new rhythms, but make hearing the old ones extremely difficult.
Forms of power include, among others, [[Stormform\|stormform]], [[Nightform\|nightform]], [[Smokeform\|smokeform]], [[Decayform\|decayform]], and [[Envoyform\|envoyform]].

**For a list of known Regal forms, see [[/wiki/Regal#Known Forms of Power]].**
## Slaveform
  A parshman servant
>“*They may have taken your freedom, but they took our **minds**.*”
\-Sah to Kaladin on their respective forms of slavery[9]


The term **slaveform** is how listeners describe singers with no [[Spren\|spren]] bond, no form, and vastly limited mental capacity; humans refer to such singers as the **parshmen**. It looks visually similar to dullform, enough so that humans can confuse the two. Slaveform did not exist until after the [[False Desolation\|False Desolation]]. It was created when [[Melishi\|Melishi]] led a strike team to capture [[Ba-Ado-Mishram\|Ba-Ado-Mishram]], who was providing the singers with [[Regal\|Regal]] forms. Though successful, it had an unintended side effect of robbing singers of [[Connection\|Connection]] and [[Identity\|Identity]], and thus creating slaveform.
Physically, slaveform singers are strong enough to perform physical labor. However, they lack [[Identity\|Identity]] and [[Connection\|Connection]], rendering them mentally stunted. Though seemingly capable of feeling and understanding their situation, they cannot fully comprehend it. Their awareness is dreamlike and they have no capacity to understand fully or act on their feelings. They are capable of processing and understanding orders, and will obey without question. When left on their own, they sit around, not doing anything.
Despite this, slaveform singers do retain some mental faculty. They can speak, though rarely do so. They care about and are protective of their dead, usually objecting to anyone tending to them. They also care for their young, though they have little capacity to object if separated. The passing of the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]] has healed the parshmen by restoring their [[Connection\|Connection]] and [[Identity\|Identity]]. As such, this form no longer exists during the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]].

### Exploitation
Prior to the arrival of the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]], parshmen are used as slave labor across the entirety of [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. Parshmen slaves are typically more expensive than human ones, due to being naturally obedient and extremely unlikely to attempt an escape. Singers who can successfully birth healthy children are purposefully bred, and often sold off on this basis, even if this requires splitting up families.
They are often used as servants, as well as heavy menial labor. They are used as porters in various locations around the world, hauling both cargo and carriages. Many countries rely on them for their economy and proper functioning of their cities; the loss of their labor due to the Everstorm would spell a crisis even without the ongoing war.

## Rhythms
For more information, see [[Rhythm\|Rhythm]].
Singers are connected to rhythms, the underlying "beats" of the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]] that manifest particularly strongly on [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. There are numerous rhythms, and singers can attune to any one of them. Each rhythm represents a certain state of mind, emotion or feeling; when not paying attention, singers will attune to the rhythm that corresponds to their mood, but can also attune another to fit with their message. This attuning manifests as hearing the beat of the rhythm in one's head. All rhythms connect the singers to each other and [[Roshar\|Roshar]] itself. This, and their regular nature, allows the singers to use the rhythms for measuring time, among others.
The singers speak and sing to the rhythms; they carry the singers' emotions, as well as add meaning to their words. However, not all forms can attune the rhythms equally. Dullform can only hear them weakly; slaveform cannot hear them at all. Additionally, those infused with the power of [[Odium\|Odium]], mainly the [[Regal\|Regals]] and the [[Fused\|Fused]], can only hear Odium's rhythms, also called the Rhythms of Power. Those rhythms, while similar to regular ones, are usually more violent and aggressive, and represent more twisted, angrier emotions -- for example, Ridicule replaces Amusement, and Command approximates Appreciation. They also feel and sound different than the ordinary rhythms.
[[Soother\|Soothers]] can affect singer rhythms and may dampen Odium's influence. Singers with the Third [[Heightening\|Heightening]] would be able to sing Pure Tones of planets other than Roshar, and could potentially do this before the Third Heightening.

## History
### Creation
The singers predate the arrival of humans on Roshar, having been created by Adonalsium as part of the planet's natural ecosystem.

### The Dawnsingers
>“*Our pity destroyed us.*”
\-From the Eila Stele[6]


After the [[Expulsion\|Expulsion]], in which mankind accidentally destroyed their homeworld, [[Ashyn\|Ashyn]], the ancient singers were ordered by their gods [[Honor\|Honor]] and [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]] to help the human refugees who arrived on their planet. These ancient singers were known as the Dawnsingers. Initially, the two species interacted peaceably, with some singers and humans even intermingling, creating [[Herdazian\|Herdazians]] and the [[Unkalaki\|Unkalaki]].
However, mankind's arrival also brought [[Odium\|Odium]], and conflict soon began. Humans, originally granted only the land of [[Shinovar\|Shinovar]], sought to expand, causing the conflict that would eventually come to be known as the [[First Desolation\|First Desolation]]. During that time, the singers came to call humans "Voidbringers", as humans cannot hear the rhythms. In that conflict, [[Spren\|spren]] eventually came to side with humans, leading to a sense of deep betrayal in the singers. It seems that the singers did something that caused the spren to turn on them.

### The Fused
For more information, see [[Fused\|Fused]].
  A flying <<Fused\|Fused>>
At some point, [[Honor\|Honor]] and [[Cultivation\|Cultivation]] sided with the humans, while singers came to work with [[Odium\|Odium]], who granted their most valiant warriors immortality and great power to fight against the humans. This power made them into [[Cognitive Shadow\|Cognitive Shadows]], and allowed them to be reborn by possessing the bodies of other singers. Those immortal singers came to be known as the Fused. The Fused became both gods and rulers of the singers, despising mankind, wanting humans wiped off Roshar regardless of the cost.
To combat the Fused, Honor created the ten [[Herald\|Heralds]], who would imprison them on [[Braize\|Braize]] until one of them broke, whereupon the Fused and Heralds would return to Roshar and a new [[Desolation\|Desolation]] would begin. The cycle continued for many centuries until finally, at the [[Aharietiam\|Aharietiam]], the Heralds decided to leave only the strongest among them, [[Taln\|Taln]], to face the torture alone.
Not all singers, however, were eager to battle mankind continuously for Odium. One such group, the **Last Legion**, abandoned the [[Regal\|Regal]] forms granted to them by Odium and left for the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]], where they would settled, far from the ongoing conflict. They would eventually dub themselves the **[[Listener\|listeners]]**.

### The parsh
>“*The parsh, as they are now called, continue their war with zeal, even without their masters from Damnation.*”
\-From the Urithiru gem archive[4]


The singers, no longer the dominant species on Roshar, continued to fight mankind and the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]]. Over the centuries, they came to be known as the **parsh**, though the meaning of the word is unclear.
Around two thousand years after the Last Desolation, near the Recreance, another conflict between the two species flared up. Dubbed the [[False Desolation\|False Desolation]], it was notable for the participation of [[Ba-Ado-Mishram\|Ba-Ado-Mishram]], one of [[Odium\|Odium's]] [[Unmade\|Unmade]]. Ba-Ado-Mishram Connected with the singers and provided them [[Regal\|Regal]] forms and [[Voidlight\|Voidlight]], as Odium once did in the Desolations, allowing the singers to wage war at levels closer to those of the real Desolations. In response, the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] imprisoned Ba-Ado-Mishram. They succeeded, but in doing so, stole part of singers' souls, ripping out their [[Connection\|Connection]] and [[Identity\|Identity]] and turning them into near-mindless husks.
These singers without form -- "slaveforms" to listeners, and **parshmen** to humans -- became the property of humans, turned into cheap, menial labor that would be exploited for millennia to come. The only ones who escaped that fate were the listeners, as they had broken ties with the [[Unmade\|Unmade]] and [[Odium\|Odium]].

### The listeners
For more information, see [[Listener\|Listener]].
  A <<Listener\|listener>> army
The listeners lived on in the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] for the next few millennia, forming a number of tribes settled in the craters around the western edge of the Plains. Eventually, they made contact with the Alethi and, through diplomatic efforts, forged a treaty. However, on the night the treaty was to be signed, the listener [[Eshonai\|Eshonai]] learned about King [[Gavilar\|Gavilar's]] plans to return the "listener gods" -- the [[Fused\|Fused]] -- to Roshar. Fearing the consequences, the listeners arranged for Gavilar to be assassinated. As a result, they were forced to flee, abandoning their homes for the more distant plateau of [[Narak\|Narak]] right as humans arrived to exact vengeance. Thus began the [[War of Reckoning\|War of Reckoning]].
After six years of constant warfare, the listeners, manipulated by one of the [[Voidspren\|voidspren]], recovered stormform, one of the forms of power. Spurred on by its mental state, they planned to summon the [[Everstorm\|Everstorm]], which they succeeded at during the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]]. As it passed over Roshar, the Everstorm restored all parshmen, healing their [[Connection\|Connection]] and [[Identity\|Identity]].

### The new singers
>“*Can't we simply enjoy being able to **think**? Being able to **exist**?*”

The newly restored singers assumed seemingly random forms. Their attitudes were similar to those of the humans they spent their entire lives around -- the [[Alethi\|Alethi]] singers were angry and warlike, the [[Azish\|Azish]] singers wished to negotiate with the government, and the [[Thaylen\|Thaylen]] singers stole ships and sailed away. Most of them, however, were quickly swept up by the [[Fused\|Fused]], who had returned and sought to create new armies with which to conquer Roshar.
To make these new singers more combat-ready, the Fused employed not only their natural anger at their former oppressors, but also hefty amounts of propaganda, most notably using the supposedly last [[Listener\|listener]], [[Venli\|Venli]], as their mouthpiece. However, many singers were still apprehensive about fighting humans, and some outright wished that peace was an option. Some singers used the term *essai* to describe a human supporter (though the actual translation means "hairy").
