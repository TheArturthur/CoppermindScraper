**Chicken** is the name used by many [[Roshar\|Rosharan]] cultures -- excluding the [[Shin\|Shin]] and the [[Unkalaki\|Unkalaki]] -- to refer to all species of birds. Only some are what would be called chickens in any other part of the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]], such as [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. The term coming to mean all birds is a result of [[Vorin\|Vorin]] languages tending towards generalization, similar to how all alcohols became wines and all small creatures became [[Cremling\|cremlings]].
Chickens are not native to [[Roshar\|Roshar]], but were brought to the planet during the initial human migration from [[Ashyn\|Ashyn]]. They live mainly in [[Shinovar\|Shinovar]] and are plentiful there. Very few birds are found in most of eastern Alethkar; wild sightings are essentially unheard of in [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]]. There are some exceptions, as wild geese live in the [[Horneater Peaks\|Horneater Peaks]] and [[Felt\|Felt]] notes that other wild birds range as far east as the [[Valley\|Valley]].
Most easterners have a very poor understanding of the anatomy and behavior of chickens. By the time of the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], more people began to recognize the differences between various species of birds, but the term chicken was still firmly entrenched in the Vorin vernacular.

## Uses
Chickens are often edible, and are therefore an export of Shinovar. [[Vstim\|Vstim]] trades with [[Thresh\|Thresh]] (and likely other Shin) for chickens that he sells to customers in the east at high prices. Chicken as a food is therefore relatively uncommon in the [[Vorin\|Vorin]] nations, and is even served at royal feasts. [[Adolin Kholin\|Adolin Kholin]] believes that eating chicken brings good luck and always eats some before his duels.
Very expensive arrows may be fletched with chicken feathers. The elder [[Tanalan's father\|Tanalan]] wore decorative feathers on his battle helm, which Dalinar found odd. Since wild geese live in the Horneater Peaks, [[Unkalaki\|Unkalaki]] arrows are often fletched with geese feathers and the [[/wiki/Unkalaki#language]] has a word for goose.

## Notable 'Chickens'
[[Jeksonofnone\|Jeksonofnone]], a bright green chicken brought by a [[Thaylen\|Thaylen]] merchant to the [[Middlefest Fair\|Middlefest Fair]] which could say its name upon command.
[[Mraize\|Mraize]] owns an [[Aviar\|Aviar]] which is referred to as a 'green chicken' by Shallan.
[[Lift\|Lift]] finds another Aviar, a red 'chicken' that belonged to an [[Gereh\|old Feruchemist]] who was killed by [[Mraize\|Mraize]] during the occupation of [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]]. She is now raising the bird.
[[Shallan\|Shallan]] observes a 'chicken' with red, blue, and green feathers when she is at the Shattered Plains menagerie with [[Adolin\|Adolin]] and [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]].
