Jonathan first met Holly at the [[Riverside Marketplace\|Riverside Marketplace]], at [[Stilla\|Stilla]]’s citrus stand. Once they were married, they lived in their apartment together, with Jonathan often going to scientific conferences and giving talks. During his investigation about the phycology of checkouts, he met , who gave her name as Jane Doe. Over time, Jonathan became severely depressed, and wasn’t finding meaning in his life. He went on a trip to the Roan Valley, and he checked out. The government unlawfully made a provisional replica of him, which killed Jonathan and took his place.
