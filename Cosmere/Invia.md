**Invia** is a scholar on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
Her writings on the [[Order of Willshapers\|Order of Willshapers]] were discussed in the book *[[Words of Radiance (in-world)\|Words of Radiance]]*. She wrote that they were "capricious, frustrating, unreliable". The author of *Words of Radiance* agreed that they were erratic, but believed that Invia's view may have been intolerant; individual Willshapers were inconsistent in temperament, more so than other Orders of the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]].
