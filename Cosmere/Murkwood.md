**Murkwood** is an [[Epic\|Epic]] formerly known as **Lincoln**. His powers and weakness are unknown.
He was friends with [[Jonathan Phaedrus\|Jonathan Phaedrus]] and [[Tia\|Tia]] prior to the formation of the [[Reckoners\|Reckoners]]. He attempted to form a superhero team alongside Phaedrus, [[Amala\|Amala]], and [[Abigail Reed\|Abigail Reed]]. Along with the others on the team, he would frequently observe [[Calamity (Epic)\|Calamity]] in the sky through a telescope. He eventually succumbed to the corrupting influence of Calamity and turned evil. His subsequent fate is unknown, although it is possible that he is alive since the younger Reckoners know of him.

## Trivia
Prof notes that Murkwood "always did love those sparking books" when discussing his Epic name. This implies that his codename is a reference to , a forest prominently featured in J.R.R. Tolkien's work, and that Tolkien's Middle-earth stories exist in the alternate universe of the Reckoners.
