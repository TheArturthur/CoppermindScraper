**Ketol** is an [[Arelene\|Arelene]] court attendant on [[Sel\|Sel]]. He is a tall, gaunt man with a bored expression who does his job well but without excitement.
King [[Iadon\|Iadon]] sent Ketol to meet [[Sarene\|Sarene]] when she arrived in [[Kae\|Kae]]. He was the one to inform her of [[Raoden\|Raoden's]] "death". When Sarene asked to see Raoden's casket, Ketol protested that he had been told to take her to the king right away. He gave in, however, and took her to the funeral tent, where he and some packmen cleared a path to the casket. Afterwards, Ketol took Sarene to the court and instructed her on how to approach the king.
