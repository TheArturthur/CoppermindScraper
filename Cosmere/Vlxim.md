**Vlxim** is a [[Thaylen\|Thaylen]] sailor and a helmsman of the [[Wandersail (1174 ship)\|Wandersail]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Appearance and Personality
Vlxim has the long white eyebrows characteristic of his people. He is bald, and is known to play the mouth harp.

## History
Vlxim and the others received training on how to sail the Wandersail through highstorms, and Vlxim claimed to have sailed through one.
For many months, Vlxim was part of a crew trained under captain [[Drlwan\|Drlwan]] to sail the [[Wandersail (1174 ship)\|Wandersail]], owned by merchant [[Vstim\|Vstim]]. When Vstim retired, the ship was inherited by Vstim's apprentice, [[Rysn Ftori\|Rysn Ftori]], who assumed command of it and its crew.
In a [[Expedition to Akinah\|mission]] led by Rysn, Vlxim sailed to [[Akinah\|Akinah]] as part of the crew of the *Wandersail*. Vlxim was the helmsman of the ship when it penetrated through the terrible [[/wiki/Akinah#Protection Storm]], and he successfully brought the ship safely to the other side. Vlxim had three other sailors standing by to help him with the wheel during the storm, even though it had a mechanism built in to help the helmsman. When the ship approached their mythical destination, Vlxim and the ship's captain, [[Drlwan\|Drlwan]], were the first to stare at the distant island in awe.
