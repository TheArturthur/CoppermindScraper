**Beldre** is a half-[[Skaa\|skaa]] and half-[[Noble\|noble]] [[Steel\|steel]] [[Misting\|Misting]] (aka a [[Coinshot\|Coinshot]]) from [[Urteau\|Urteau]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]].
She is [[Quellion\|Quellion's]] sister. She has deep auburn hair, green eyes and is described by [[Spook\|Spook]] as being able to wear a [[Skaa\|skaa]] dress with "striking elegance". Beldre is naive and trusting, and is aware of these traits. She also demonstrates her inexperience when she shows up alone at Spook's hideout.
Beldre does not especially like confrontation, but will stand up for what she believes is right. When Spook first causes a scene during one of Quellion's speeches, she uses her [[Allomancy\|Allomancy]] to stop him from killing one of the guards with a sword, although Spook assumes that Quellion is the Coinshot.
She later reveals herself as a Coinshot when defending her brother from Spook's [[Ruin\|Ruin]]-influenced attempt at murder.
She has a relationship with Spook after the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]].
