## Appearance and Personality
He is a "stocky, bejowled fellow." Like the rest of the Wall Guard, he is [[Lighteyes\|lighteyed]], presumably of the fourth [[Dahn\|dahn]] due to his rank.

## Attributes and Abilities
It is not known how Hadinar came to serve in the Wall Guard, but he appears to be very knowledgeable regarding Kholinar. He commanded one of the four battalions of the Wall Guard under Azure. He is one of her primary officers, and appears to be the one that she trusts the most. He is aware of several secrets held by Azure, including her gender and the method that she was using to prevent detection of a [[/wiki/Soulcasting#Fabrials]] by the [[Screamers\|screamers]].

## History
Hadinar was Azure's only officer present at a meeting with [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] when he revealed his mission under [[Elhokar\|Elhokar]] and the existence of the [[Oathgate\|Oathgates]]. He briefly spoke to [[Beard\|Beard]] about the secret passageways in the Kholinar walls and [[Windblades\|windblades]].

## Trivia
Because Hadinar seems to be a confidant of Azure, fans have speculated that he is also a [[Worldhopper\|worldhopper]]; Brandon has only responded with [[RAFO\|RAFO]] when asked about him.
