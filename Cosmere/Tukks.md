## Appearance and Personality
Tukks is younger than most sergeants. He is a short man with sunken cheeks, and there is something "off" about his features. He sometimes chews [[Fathom tree\|fathom]] bark.
Tukks often chides his men and Kaladin considers him to be "loud, intolerant, and profoundly acerbic", although he admits that he is wise. Tukks is far more empathetic and introspective than other soldiers.

## Attributes and Abilities
Tukks is highly skilled with a spear, as he trains other soldiers to wield them in battle. He is shocked by Kaladin's natural proficiency with the weapon, and is able to help him refine his abilities. He emphasizes the need to practice, both to build skill and to avoid freezing in combat.
Tukks is an effective military leader. He was promoted to sergeant at a young age, and has a good understanding of the dynamics of his squad. He tries to address facets of their personalities that could negatively affect them on the battlefield. He will discipline them as necessary by assigning them to menial duties or perhaps using corporal punishment.

## History
Tukks joined [[Meridas Amaram\|Meridas Amaram]]'s army at some point in his youth. By 1169, he was a sergeant and led a squad known as the [[Takers\|Takers]] that participated in border skirmishes in the [[Sadeas princedom\|Sadeas princedom]]. Kaladin was assigned to this squad when he joined the army. Although Tukks did help improve Kaladin's combat skills, his enduring effect on Kaladin was advising him of the need to feel emotion in the midst of battle and to fight with cause.
Tukks was also able to locate [[Tien\|Tien]] on Kaladin's behalf, informing Kaladin that his brother was serving in the Seventh Battalion. He offered to try to get Tien transferred to the Takers, but this never came about.
Tukks died while in Amaram's army, presumably during a battle where Kaladin was present; he is one of the people that Kaladin regrets being unable to protect. It is unclear what happened to the Takers after Tukks died; Kaladin was soon given command of [[Kaladin's squad\|his own squad]] that was not known to use the name.

## Relationships
### Kaladin
>“*Don't worry about the war, or even the battle. Focus on your squadmates, Kal. Keep **them** alive. Be the man **they** need.*”
\-Tukks[3]

During his training with the Takers, Kaladin froze up while sparring on the practice field, and keenly recalled his subsequent conversation with Tukks. Tukks emphasized that it was normal to feel fear and passion while fighting, and that not everyone dealt with it the same way. He would not want to fight alongside people who felt no emotion. Kaladin struggled to reconcile how Tukks could allow himself to care and still hurt people, and Tukks said he focused on keeping his squadmates alive. Kaladin had difficulty understanding Tukks's point of view at first, but later realized that caring about the fight was the difference between retaining your humanity and becoming a murderer. He did not freeze on the battlefield again until the [[Siege of Kholinar\|Siege of Kholinar]], when he was forced to watch two groups of friends killing each other.
Kaladin looks back on his time with Tukks fondly. The need to feel emotion on the battlefield was the first lesson that he taught [[Bridge Four\|Bridge Four]]. He feels a sense of familiarity and strength when he falls into a stance that Tukks taught him.

## Quotes
>“*The first step is to care. Some talk about being emotionless in battle. Well, I suppose it's important to keep your head. But I hate that feeling of killing while calm and cold. I've seen that those who care fight harder, longer, and better than those who don't. It's the difference between mercenaries and real soldiers. It's the difference between fighting to defend your homeland and fighting on foreign stone.It's good to care when you fight, so long as you don't let it consume you. Don't try to stop yourself from feeling. You'll hate who you become.*”
\-Tukks's advice to Kaladin[4]


>“*A lot of soldiers, they think that you fight the best if you’re passionless and cold. I think that’s stormleavings. Yes, you need to be focused. Yes, emotions are dangerous. But if you don’t care about anything, what are you? An animal, driven only to kill. Our passion is what makes us human. We have to fight for a reason. So I say that it’s all right to care. We’ll talk about controlling your fear and anger, but remember this as the first lesson I taught you.*”
\-Kaladin passing on Tukks's lesson to Bridge Four[10]
