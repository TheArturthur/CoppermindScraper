**Vila Mecant** is a [[Coinshot\|coinshot]] from Scadrial and an antagonist of [[Nicki Savage\|Nicki Savage]].
She wanted the 'Compass of Spirits' for herself and so stole it from Nicki and her companions but forgot the key in the process. Nicki came up with a plan to catch up to Vila in time and correctly deduced that Vila was planning to find them again in order to retrieve the key, the pair fought while clinging onto the wings of an ornisaur. Nicki leeched Villa's steel reserves and won the battle, managing to catch Vila before she fell. In response Vila punched Nicki in the face causing her to instinctively let go of Vila causing her to plummet.
