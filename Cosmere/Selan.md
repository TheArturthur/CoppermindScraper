## Geography
### Territories and Features
#### Territories
Sela Tales lies in the middle of [[Roshar\|Roshar]], stretching from the [[Misted Mountains\|Misted Mountains]] in the west to the plains of [[Valhav\|Valhav]] in the east. To the east, it borders [[Valhav\|Valhav]] while to the north, it borders the [[Reshi Sea\|Reshi Sea]] It also lies next to [[Makabakam\|Makabakam]] in the south. It is located very close to a number of islands belonging to [[Rishir\|Rishir]]. It also borders [[Shin Kak Nish\|Shin Kak Nish]] and [[Iri\|Iri]] respectively in the west and north-west. Besides the mainland, the Selay people governed a number of territories off the coast. These islands are all located on the [[Reshi Sea\|Reshi Sea]].

#### Geographic Features
Sela Tales is home to the [[Purelake\|Purelake]], a shallow lake that extends for hundreds of miles. It controls nearly the entire coast of this lake, but [[Valhav\|Valhav]] controls the easternmost portion. Sela Tales also has a number of great rivers running through it, most of which end in either the Reshi sea or the Purelake.

## Culture
#### Ethnicity and People
The people of Sela Tales are called Selay. The Selay people have distinctive ripple patterns on their skin. They, like most other Rosharans, also have epicanthic folds. After the kingdomâ€™s collapse, some of the Selay were ruled by gerontarchs which is likely a cultural remnant of Sela Tales, although this does not mean that the Selay king was also a gerontarch.

#### Writing and language
The Selay spoke an ancient form of the Selay language. This language belongs to the The [[Iri\|Iri]] language family, which, alongside Selay, also contains the languages of the Iriali, [[Riran\|Rirans]] and the [[Reshi\|Reshi]]. The various [[Purelake\|Purelake]] dialects, and some other surrounding languages, were also part of this language family. The people of Sela Tales wrote in the [[Dawnchant\|Dawnchant]].

## History
### Creation of Roshar
The land that would become known as Sela Tales was created at an unknown point before the [[Shattering\|Shattering]] by [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]], along with the rest of Roshar and the Rosharan supercontinent over ten-thousand years prior to Vorin year 1174. It is unclear how much the geography of Sela Tales has changed compared to the land at creation.

### Pre-Human Arrival
Before humanity arrived on Roshar from Ashyn, the land that would come to be known as Sela Tales was inhabited by [[Singers\|Singers]].
Circa -5825 in the Vorin calendar, humanity arrived on Roshar after fleeing Ashyn and were granted the land that would become [[Shin Kak Nish\|Shin Kak Nish]]. After less than a generation, they headed an invasion, slaughtering some of the Singers and expelling them from their land, claiming it as their own, this included the land that would come to be known as Sela Tales. This history was lost to man until the discovery of the [[Eila Stele\|Eila Stele]].

### The Establishment of Sela Tales
  Map of the Silver Kingdoms
 was founded in the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]] Epoch. Due to the Desolations, the Selay were constantly returned back to early technological levels, often to the point of having to make use of stone tools. Though they advanced each time with the help of the Heralds whenever they returned, often receiving this assistance from [[Kalak\|Kalak]] and his [[Willshapers\|Willshapers]]. Old manuscripts and texts dating back to these times mention quick-spreading diseases in the east that killed tens of thousands, and it is likely that at least some of these diseases spread to Sela Tales.
Very early in the nation's history, the city of [[Panatham\|Panatham]] was created and made into its capital. Panatham was eventually made into the home of the Selay Oathgate.

#### Further Desolations
The Sixth Epoch lasted at least thirty-one years, and likely significantly longer, before its Desolation arrived.
One of the many Desolations that struck the nation, along with the rest of Roshar, arrived in the year 337 of the Eighth Epoch. This Desolation was heralded by the release of [[Midnight Essence\|Midnight Essence]] in a small settlement in [[Natanatan\|Natanatan]]. The length of this Desolation is unknown. During the Desolations, the Selay undertook a number of large building and fortification projects, and atleast one large stone fortress located on the Purelake was maintained by Sela Tales.
Another Desolation occurred later and ended circa -3333, during an unknown Epoch. This left society wounded and weak, forcing them into a period of recovery.

#### The Last Desolation (c.-3332)
The Last Desolation was a large scale Desolation which occurred circa -3332, around 4500 years before the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]]. This Desolation was particularly devasting due to the fact that it happened only a year after the previous Desolation, and thus society was weakened and still recovering. Tired of the Desolations and their torture on Braize, the nine Heralds still on Roshar refused to return to Braize, leaving Taln as the sole Herald on the planet for millennia.
After the Last Desolation, Desolations ceased to ravage the nation. Due to this, society was able to advance much further than ever before, giving them the strength to potentially resist any potential Desolation without complete societal collapse. The era heralded by the Last Desolation came to be known as the Era of Solitude.

#### After Aharietiam
At some unknown point in history, after Aharietiam, Sela Tales collapsed. 4500 years after the Last Desolation, the area that was Sela Tales had fractured into multiple kingdoms, and some regions like the Purelake were ungoverned. These kingdoms still had many shared cultural aspects though, and the area in which they lay was still called Sela Tales, after the silver kingdom. The peoples were also grouped together, under the name Selay. After the Recreance, the Selay acquired several sets of [[Shardblade\|Shardblades]] and [[Shardplate\|Shardplate]].
