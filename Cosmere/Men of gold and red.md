>“*You are fools! One day, the men of gold and red, bearers of the final metal, will come to you. And you will be ruled by them. Worship. Worship Trell and wait ...*”
\-Miles Dagouter's last words[1]


The **men of gold and red** is an army under the direct command of [[Autonomy\|Autonomy]] which she uses to invade and conquer other worlds failing her other efforts to rule them. The soldiers themselves have golden skin and glowing red eyes; they are also remarked to appear quite statuesque. There are at least several thousand of them and they have access to rifles that [[Marasi Colms\|Marasi Colms]] considered advanced in 348 [[Catacendre\|PC]]. Throughout its history the army has only had to be used a handful of times; when unleashed they are said to be quite difficult to control. It is unknown what worlds they were sent to but [[TwinSoul\|TwinSoul]] claims to have personally seen their destructive potential.
This army was the one that Autonomy intended to use to invade [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]], her intentions with this remain somewhat unclear. A member of the [[Set\|Set]], [[Miles Dagouter\|Miles Dagouter]], seemed of the opinion that this army was geared to conquer and then rule Scadrial, while [[Gave Entrone\|Gave Entrone]] instead seemed convinced they would simply slaughter its inhabitants. Miles also mentioned that they would wield a previously unknown metal, a possible reference to [[Trellium\|trellium]]. The invasion was ultimately prevented from taking place after constable Marasi Colms, with the help of those trapped in the [[Community\|Community]], managed to collapse the [[Perpendicularity\|perpendicularity]] the troops were meant to use.

## Origin and Invested Arts
The original world of the men of gold and red is unknown, however some of their members are from a known [[Shardworld\|Shardworld]] and use a known Invested Art. As of that time the only known Shardworlds were that of [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]], [[Roshar\|Roshar]], [[Sel\|Sel]], [[Taldain\|Taldain]], [[Threnody\|Threnody]], and [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]]. Seeing as the army was set to invade Scadrial at the time it is unlikely any of their number originates from there. Although each Shard does have an associated color just because a Shard may be associated with gold or red does not necessarily mean they are associated with this army.

Stepping away from concete information some details of the origin of the men of gold and red could be guessed from what we have. Due to their advanced weaponrary it can be presumed that they orignate from a technologically developed world, as well as one that would have a sizeable and stable perpendicularity for them to access and use in order to initially enter the cognitive realm. If these two factors are accepted as true one may then eliminate Roshar and Threnody from the list of viable canditates. Accepting as well that Scadrial is unlikely to fight for its own destruction we are then left with Sel, Taldain and Nalthis as potential world of origins.
Taldain itself is notable for being more technologically advanced than Scadrial and also being inhabited by an [[Sand Lord\|Avatar of Autonomy]], however it must also be kept in mind that that for reasons unknown Autonomy sought the destruction of the users of their Invested Art on that world and later enacted a policy of isolationism on it. Both of these factors make Taldain less obvious a choice. For Sel and Nalthis both planets have no confirmed history of intrusion from Autonomy and each were inhabited by a different [[Shard\|Shard]] making it unlikely for Autonomy's involvement, however it has been noted by some a similarity between the description of the [[Sorceress\|Sorceress']] army and the men of gold and red. From this then it is possible that both worlds had some connection to the origins of this force.
