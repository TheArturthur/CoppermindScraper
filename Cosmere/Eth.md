## Appearance and Personality
Eth seems to have a good-humored personality and enjoys needling his friends, including [[Skar\|Skar]] and [[Rock\|Rock]]. Like many people, he is relatively ignorant regarding [[Listener\|listener]] culture.

## Attributes and Abilities
Eth and a number of the other bridgemen receive basic field medic training from [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]]. He also has combat training and is presumably considered to be a competent fighter, since he is assigned to guard the king on several occasions. Eth becomes a [[Windrunner\|Windrunner]] squire to [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]], giving him some limited abilities with [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]] when he is near Kaladin. He was one of several bridgemen that carried [[Jezrien\|Jezrien's]] [[Honorblade\|Honorblade]], although it is unclear if he actually used it.

## History
Eth and [[Mart\|Mart]] were caught planning to desert, and they were sent to the [[Bridge crew\|bridge crews]] as punishment.
After [[Dalinar\|Dalinar]] freed Bridge Four, Eth often served as a personal guard for the Kholins alongside his brother and other Bridge Four members. He guarded the door during a meeting that Dalinar and [[Elhokar\|Elhokar]] held at the [[Pinnacle\|Pinnacle]], preventing anyone but Highprinces from entering without permission. During [[Szeth\|Szeth's]] attack on Dalinar, Mart and Eth were assigned to guard the king. After the attack, Eth treated [[Adolin\|Adolin's]] and Dalinar's wounds before Kaladin returned to them. Eth also served as a guard for Adolin. He was present during one of Kaladin's [[Shardblade\|Shardblade]] training sessions and guarded the room where Adolin prepared for his duel against four [[Shardbearer\|Shardbearers]].
Eth survived Szeth's attack on Dalinar during the [[Battle of Narak\|Battle of Narak]], but his brother Mart did not; Eth mourned over his body.
He was present during [[Shallan\|Shallan's]] investigation of [[Re-Shephir\|Re-Shephir]] and did not seem to fear the [[Unmade\|Unmade]].
Eth became a Radiant squire to Kaladin and in one training session stuck a rock to his hand with an errant [[Lashing\|Lashing]], amusing his friends.
During another practice exercise of Bridge Four, Eth used the term "shellheads" in reference to the [[Voidbringers\|Voidbringers]] before hastily telling [[Rlain\|Rlain]] that he didn't mean any offense. He asked Rlain if he knew why the [[Fused\|Fused]] were attacking trade caravans on the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]]. Eth called the Fused Rlain's "kinsmen," to which Rlain responded by saying that the Fused were his enemy and he and his people had spent their entire lives hiding from their old gods.
Before the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]], [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]] sent a member of the [[Diagram (group)\|Diagram]] to Bridge Four's barracks to steal [[Jezrien\|Jezrien's]] [[Honorblade\|Honorblade]], which Eth was holding at the time. The assassin used [[Teft\|Teft's]] Bridge Four uniform coat as a disguise to get into the area. During the attack, Rock and [[Bisig\|Bisig]] were badly injured and Eth was killed. Teft felt responsible for Eth's death.
