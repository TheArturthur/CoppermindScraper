## Politics
### Spacial States

This plan of Varion's was against the Emperor's wishes.

## Military
The High Empire retains a sizable assemblage of forces, containing multiple fleets. Each fleet is generally led by a flagship, then followed by a number of cruisers, longships, and finally accompanied by a number of fighter squadrons. In addition to the High Empire, the planet [[Utaries\|Utaries]] maintained a sizable retinue of ships, lending to their capability of marshaling other planets to their cause.

The [[Imperial Homeworld\|Imperial Homeworld]] itself contains significant points of interest, such as the [[Officer's Walk\|Officer's Walk]] and the [[Point\|Point]].

### Reaches

Travel across Imperial space to the reaches can take anywhere from 3+ days, and for quickness in travel, is often achieved by way of speeder. Notable systems in the Reaches are the [[Utaries\|Utaries]], [[Seapress\|Seapress]] and [[Farnight\|Farnight]], among others.
