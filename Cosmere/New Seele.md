**New Seele** is a planet in the [[High Empire\|High Empire]].
It is an important planet, near the core of the empire, and is home to an imperial fleet. By the end of the [[Reunification War\|Reunification War]], however, the empire's forces were stretched thin, as they had been pushing outward to hold their newly re-expanded borders. As a result, New Seele was one of the ten locations [[Varion Crestmar\|Varion Crestmar]] attacked in his rebellion against the empire. The attacks were ultimately repulsed after his brother, [[Dennison Crestmar\|Dennison Crestmar]], used a bug in Varion's ** transmitter to send him fake reports about the battle.
