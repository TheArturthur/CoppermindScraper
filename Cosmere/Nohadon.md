## Name
"Nohadon" is not his real name, but rather a holy honorific given to him by the [[Vorin\|Vorin]] [[Ardent\|ardents]] thousands of years after his death (under Vorin rules, the letter "h" can stand in for any other letter, making "Nohadon" perfectly symmetrical and thus holy). Elsewhere, he is known as **Bajerden** or **Behardan**, though whether this is his original name is uncertain.

## Appearance and Personality
In his youth, Nohadon had dark hair, which he wore pulled back into a braid, and a short, pointy beard. It can be presumed he was [[Lighteyes\|lighteyed]]. As he got older, his hair went gray and he gained numerous wrinkles, but the pointy beard remained. When dressed as a king, he had golden threads winding through his hair, coming together on his forehead in the shape of the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]] symbol, and wore white-and-gold robes with voluminous sleeves.
[[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] thought that the [[Herald\|Herald]] [[Ishar\|Ishar]] would look similar to Nohadon. Though it turned out not to be the case.
Young Nohadon was an angry, exhausted man, likely due to having just suffered through a war. He was uncertain of himself and his goals, and sought advice on statecraft from his advisors. At some point, he even considered abdicating the throne. Nonetheless, he had a clear vision of what he wanted to accomplish: to have the [[Surgebinder\|Surgebinders]] serve people, rather than rule over them. He believed that he had to enforce this, even if he had to go to war to do so.
In his older age, Nohadon became significantly more glib, whimsical and better-natured, having greatly matured over the decades. He had a wry, somewhat sarcastic sense of humor, and a charitable nature, chatting with common citizens and giving food out to the poor. He enjoyed the simple pleasures of life, like chatting with his people or shopping. He didn't hesistate to use his powers for the most banal things, like jumping several stories out the window rather than climbing down the stairs. He was, in fact, very cavalier with his safety, never taking guards with him even when going out of the palace. Nonetheless, he was sombre when recalling the dark events of the past, and had no problem dispensing wisdom he had gathered over the years.

## Attributes and Abilities
> [!info] This page or section deals with theories or speculation.Please read carefully and note that this is not necessarily canonical.

Nohadon is implied to have been an absolute monarch. His ability to completely rebuild a ruined kingdom over several decades implies considerable amount of administrative talent. Additionally, he was capable of projecting military power across vast distances, being able to take a large scout group all the way to the foothills of the [[Misted Mountains\|Misted Mountains]], on the opposite side of the continent.
He was a [[Surgebinder\|Surgebinder]] from a young age, and was said to be considered special among them, suggesting that he may have been a [[Bondsmith\|Bondsmith]]. Nonetheless, he possessed enough ability to easily survive a jump from a considerable height. He also appears to have had some knowledge of [[Realmatic Theory\|Realmatic Theory]], as he educates Highprince [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] on the existence and nature of [[Physical Realm\|Physical]], [[Cognitive Realm\|Cognitive]] and [[Spiritual Realm\|Spiritual Realms]] in a vision.
Most famously, Nohadon was a philosopher-king. His best-known work is *[[The Way of Kings (in-world)\| The Way of Kings]]*, but it's implied that he wrote several other texts on logic and philosophy.
He was also a gifted haggler, and knew how to make [[Shin\|Shin]] loaf bread, both of which were apparently his hobbies.

## History
### Life
Nohadon was a king of one of the [[Silver Kingdom\|Silver Kingdoms]], [[Alethela\|Alethela]], some time prior to year 31 of the Sixth Epoch. He became a [[Surgebinder\|Surgebinder]] early in his life, and took the throne young, during a [[Desolation\|Desolation]] that lasted for eleven years, killing nine out of ten of his subjects. This, and a prior conflict with another Surgebinder named [[Alakavish\|Alakavish]] who also started the conflict, left his kingdom in ruins and him jaded to the point where he considered abdicating. He eventually attempted to unite other Surgebinders by force, but failed. This forced him to find a different, more peaceful path.
As decades passed, Nohadon rebuilt his kingdom, until eventually it became a bustling, colorful place. At some point, he went to war over access to trade routes of [[Makabak\|Makabak]], which took him near the border of [[Shin Kak Nish\|Shin Kak Nish]]. He would stay there for a long time, in a house of a woman who would later meet a tragic fate. It was then that he learned to bake [[Shin\|Shin]] bread, a habit he enjoyed during later years of his life.
Around that time, Nohadon started a family and made his famous journey from [[Abamabar\|Abamabar]] to [[Urithiru\|Urithiru]]. He walked alone, without any guards or attendants, and no money, instead making a living through singing and manual labor. The trip took a very long time - the lowest number given is sixty days, and that was when he was still within his own lands - and when he eventually made it to Urithiru's gates, he was all but unrecognizable.
In his old age, Nohadon remained in his capital, the city now known as [[Kholinar\|Kholinar]]. He would often take walks outside of his palace, shopping and haggling without any guards.

### In Visions
For more information about [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin's]] visions, see [[Dalinar's visions\|Dalinar's visions]].
>“*Sometimes, a hypocrite is nothing more than a man who is in the process of changing.*”
\-Nohadon to Dalinar[4]

Nohadon appeared in two of [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin's]] visions. The first vision was one of the regular ones, sent by the [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]] during a [[Highstorm\|highstorm]], and cast Dalinar in the role of [[Karm\|Karm]], an advisor to the king. In it, Nohadon shared his anxieties about ruling, and his frustration with other [[Surgebinder\|Surgebinders]]. The vision was important mainly thanks to the very last thing Dalinar said in it, which was a sentence [[Navani\|Navani]] recognized, allowing her to begin the translation of [[Dawnchant\|Dawnchant]]. Later, Dalinar brought [[Venli\|Venli]] into the same vision in an attempt to parlay with her.
The second vision was far stranger, ocurring without Stormfather's input while Dalinar was asleep. In it, Dalinar spoke with older Nohadon, and walked through the city with him. Unlike the regular visions, here Nohadon was keenly aware who he was speaking to, and referenced things that had happened to Dalinar before. While this, as well as the vision's dramatic end, imply that this was a nightmare, Nohadon talked about things Dalinar didn't know at the time, such as the [[Realmatic Theory\|three Realms]] or the ancient conflict near [[Shin Kak Nish\|Shin Kak Nish]], suggesting that this might've been the real Nohadon, or some preserved memory of him.

## Legacy
 
For Nohadon's famous book, see [[The Way of Kings (in-world)\|The Way of Kings (in-world)]].
*[[The Way of Kings (in-world)\|The Way of Kings]]* is the oldest preserved text in [[Roshar\|Roshar's]] human history. Among others, [[Gavilar\|Gavilar]] and [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] were heavily impacted by it in their middle age, as it led them to rethink their life philosophy and, in Dalinar's case, led to him becoming a [[Bondsmith\|Bondsmith]]. Nohadon's influence, however, spreads far beyond [[Alethi\|Alethi]] royalty. He's one of the most influential writers in the history of Roshar, with his texts being read and analyzed by scholars to this very day. His name is immediately recognizable for people who study ancient history, logic and philosophy.
It's highly possible that Nohadon had a hand in organizing the [[Surgebinder\|Surgebinders]] into the [[Knights Radiant\|Knights Radiant]], as the ancient Knights were said to have based their philosophies and ideals off *The Way of Kings*.
He's one of the few people to ever be praised by the [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]], with the great spren considering him to have been "a good man".

## Trivia
The idea that Nohadon was one of the [[Herald\|Heralds]] has been directly debunked.
In [[The Way of Kings Prime\|The Way of Kings Prime]], Nohadon was known only by his alternative name of Bajerdan, with *The Way of Kings* being a far more revered book that served as a general rulebook for monarchs.
Nohadon was based on , a figure from the Book of Mormon.
