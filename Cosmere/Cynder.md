## Appearance and Personality
Cynder is an older man with dark skin and a bald head. He remains optimistic and frequently shows a sly sense of humor. He frequently squabbles with [[Jon Acron\|Jon Acron]] over inconsequential matters.

## History
Professor Cynder traveled to [[Dayside\|Dayside]] with Duchess [[Khrissalla\|Khrissalla]], [[Baon\|Baon]], [[Jon Acron\|Jon Acron]] and an escort of Elisian soldiers. He and Acron were fascinated with the cultural and linguistic differences of Dayside. Professor Cynder had learned "Dayside language" from five hundred year old texts imported to the Elisian University from Dayside. When they were passing through [[Dosha-Har'Ken\|Dosha-Har'Ken]], each time he approached somebody to ask for directions, they would run off without answering. While purchasing supplies from a [[Kerztian\|Kerztian]] merchant that spoke [[Dynastic\|Dynastic]], he hears a phrase he can understand coming from a speaker in the square. Cynder appraches the [[A'kar\|A'kar]], without realizing he is interrupting a sermon, but when he tries speaking to the A'kar the situation devolves rapidly, and they retreat only having learned they were blasphenomously speaking the "holy language" of the clergy.

>“*If we can't get directions out of them, then at least we can call them to repentance.*”
\-Cynder (upon discovering he learned the language of the clergy)[1]

After arriving near the base of Mount [[KraeDa\|KraeDa]], [[Flennid\|Flennid]] shot their guide, [[Daazk\|Daazk]], and left with [[Torth\|Torth]]—taking the remaining food and water. Searching the tents near the massacre for water and supplies, Cynder and Baon found [[Kenton\|Kenton]] passed out in a tent, dehydrated from his fight with the [[Kerztian\|Kerztians]], and helped revive him. When he and the travelling party were ambushed by Kerztian warriors on their way to [[Kezare\|Kezare]], Cynder was shot in the arm by a [[Zinkall\|zinkall]] arrow. Kenton showed him how to remove the arrow safely by pouring water on the wound to melt any remaining carapace fragments.
Upon arriving in [[Kezare\|Kezare]] the group discovered [[Lonzare\|Lonzare]], the Darksider section of the city. Cynder was thrilled by the mixing of Darkside and [[Lossand\|Lossandin]] culture. He suspected that a  between Dynastic and Lossandin could be developing among the people living there.
The lock on Cynder's luggage malfunctioned and was repaired by Khriss as she, unsuccessfully, sought meetings with the [[Taishin\|Taishin]]. After they discovered that Kenton had become the [[Lord Mastrell\|Lord Mastrell]] the group returned to Lonzare where Cynder, while playing a game like chess with Acron, suggested that she use her diplomatic skills to help out the Diem.
He and Kriss discussed the differences between Dayside [[Sand (Taldain)\|sand]] and [[Sandling\|sandling]] carapace, as well as Dayside sand, sand that had water poured on it, and what he beleived to be Darkside sand when she was doing experiments in her bedroom. Khriss explained that it was not Darkside sand, but sand that had had the lichen digested by sandlings, proving that sand from Dayside and Darkside were fundamentally the same, except for the lichen.
Cynder and Acron, having found more  for Khriss to use in making new gunpowder charges for Baon, interrupted Khriss and Baon as she was confronting him about the incident with Captain [[Deral\|Deral]] and his lieutenant. Shocked by what he saw, Cynder dropped the container of saltpeter to the ground where it shattered. Baon then left taking his pistols with him.
Because Kenton "accepted" Khriss as a [[Sand mastery\|sand master]] recruit for testing, Khriss, Cynder, and Acron moved into the [[Diem\|Diem]]. After they had arrived, Cynder remarked how strange it was for Baon to have turned out to be a spy, since he was always so loyal. He then suggested that any of them might also be a spy. Acron suggested they not dwell on the subject since Baon hadn't had a chance to explain himself. Khriss gave [[Gevalden\|Gevalden's]] pistol, which she had received from [[Nilto\|Nilto]], to Cynder so he could use it to guard her. He accompanied Khriss when she went with Kenton to visit [[Vey\|Vey]].
Acron went with Khriss, Kenton, and [[Delius\|Delius]] when they went to [[Lraezare\|Lraezare]] to find Vey. He helped Khriss revive Kenton when he passed out from [[Overmastery\|overmastery]].
He went with Khriss to watch Kenton's duel with [[Drile\|Drile]]. Two weeks after the final vote of the [[Taishin\|Taishin]] on the Diem's fate, Khriss, Baon, and Cynder set sail for Elis, taking barrels of white sand and a few sand masters with them.

## Quotes
>“*I wonder if they have a mixed language. A Lossandin-Dynastic Hybrid. That would be exciting now, wouldn't it?*”
\-Cynder[4]


>“*well, aren't you the magnanimous one today, Jon?*”
\-Cynder[9]


## Trivia
In [[White Sand\|White Sand Volume 1]] Jon Acron and Cynder's speech bubbles are occasionally misattributed, particularly when they converse with one another. Noting the clothing of the speaker and context of the quote is required to catch these mistakes. For example, Acron wears white in most of Volume 1, though in at least one frame their clothing was switched.
