## Appearance and Personality
>“*Ahoy!*”
\-Daazk[3]


Daazk is an upbeat young [[Kerztian\|Kerztian]] who has not yet joined a [[DaiKeen\|DaiKeen]] and does not wear a symbol. He has a warm brown skin tone and wears a white kaffiyeh with a yellow shirt, mauve robes and a tan vest.

## History
Daazk met Duchess Khrisalla's party while they were negotiating with his uncle, the only merchant in [[Dosha-Har'Ken\|Dosha-Har'Ken]] to learn [[Dynastic\|Dynastic]] and specialize in outfitting [[Darkside\|Darksider]] parties travelling across the [[Kerla\|Kerla]]. His uncle recommended him as a guide for travelling to the [[Lossand\|Lossandin]] capital, [[Kezare\|Kezare]].
While travelling the Kerla, near [[Esh'Ker'Losh\|Esh'Ker'Losh]], he tried to show Khriss how to find [[Dorim vine\|dorim vines]], but did not know enough Dynastic to explain the process, and she ignored his apparant waste of water and asked him to take them to the base of Mount [[KraeDa\|KraeDa]].
Upon arriving at the [[Diem\|Diem's]] tents near Mount KraeDa, they discovered the massacre of the [[Sand master\|sand masters]]. When [[Torth\|Torth]] showed him one of the sashes, Daazk panicked and fled, shouting the Kerztian word for sand masters—Ry'Kensha. Flennid, not understanding the situation, thought he was yelling to summon an ambush and shot him in the back as he rode away.
