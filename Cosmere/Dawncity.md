**Dawncity** is a term used to describe a city on [[Roshar\|Roshar]] that is old enough to be able to trace the origin of said city all the way back to the [[Dawnsingers\|Dawnsingers]].
As of 1173, discussing the Dawncities had recently become fashionable among the [[Alethi\|Alethi]] [[Lighteyes\|lighteyes]]. In fact, Highprince [[Hatham\|Hatham's]] wife studied the Dawncities. [[Au-nak\|Au-nak]] believed that the city of [[Sesemalex Dar\|Sesemalex Dar]] was a Dawncity, due to the complex stone patterns that the city was built within. However, no city has yet been confirmed to be a Dawncity. In [[Dalinar\|Dalinar's]] [[Dalinar's visions\|visions]], he saw no sign of any of the Dawncities.
It is believed that they may have been created by the Dawnsingers making use of an early form of [[Stoneshaping\|Stoneshaping]] to shape cities in the stone. They may also have been created with the use of [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]], although they are beyond the scope of what a single or group of Radiants could create using the power of [[Soulcasting\|Soulcasting]].
