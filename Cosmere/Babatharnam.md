## Geography and Ecology
Babatharnam borders the [[Purelake\|Purelake]], [[Yulay\|Yulay]], [[Marabethia\|Marabethia]], and [[Rira (country)\|Rira]]. Cities in Babatharnam include its capital of [[Panatham\|Panatham]] and [[Sween\|Sween]].
Babatharnam has two unnamed rivers running through it, and the border with Yulay is also an unnamed river.
Babatharnam has peculiar trees which, when a [[Highstorm\|highstorm]] approaches, completely lay down, trunk and all, as if the tree was on a hinge. The Babath are human-[[Aimian\|Aimian]] hybrids.
Babatharnam has an area of around 1,107,000 km.

## History
During the [[Heraldic Epochs\|Heraldic Epochs]] Babatharnam was part of the [[Silver kingdoms\|Silver Kingdom]] [[Sela Tales\|Sela Tales]]. All the Silver Kingdoms had a specific purpose during peacetime, teaching the others their art during a desolation so the Babath, among others, were experts in an art. After Sela Tales collapsed Babatharnam was founded.
Around the year 1120 The Monavakah dynasty was established and began assassinating rivals to stay in power. This caused a great deal of unrest in the country.
During the initial months of the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]], the Most Ancient of Babatharnam refused to cooperate with [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]]. The nation was conquered by [[Singer\|singer]] and [[Iriali\|Iriali]] forces shortly after the defection of [[Iri\|Iri]].

## Politics
Babatharnam is a gerontocracy, meaning the older one is, the more authority one has. Everyone has an opportunity to rule, if they live long enough. Anyone can become the **Most Ancient**--the Babath king.
However, in practicality, during the present day, Babatharnam is ruled by the **Monavakah Dynasty**, which executes or exiles any person old enough to challenge them. This has ensured that the Monavakahs have remained in power for fifty years. [[Sigzil\|Sigzil]] has visited Babatharnam, and recalled that the nation has a great deal of unrest from the Monavakah Dynasty's assassinations.

## Culture
The Babath are very particular to how one speaks and can be offended easily. Sigzil has managed to be imprisoned three times in Babatharnam, though he suspects the Babath use any excuse to imprison a foreigner, as his [[Hoid\|master]] had a good deal of money.
As the Babath are ethnically [[Sela Tales\|Selay]] they probably have the Selay ripple patterns on their skin.
The Babath probably have shards, as the Selay are known to have multiple sets.

## Trivia
In terms of real world nations, it is slightly larger than the total area of Ethiopia.
