## Appearance and Personality
Yake is described as stout with thick arms, and is presumably [[Darkeyes\|darkeyed]].
Yake is reliable, and is quick to follow orders. He does not seem superstitious, as he dismisses [[Maps\|Maps's]] [[Death Rattle\|Death Rattle]] as "just dying delirium". He initially seems introverted, but later opens up and often teases his fellow bridgemen.

## Powers and Abilities
Yake is trained in the use of the spear, and received some special training regarding [[Shardblade\|Shardblades]].
He became a [[Radiant\|Radiant]] [[Windrunner\|Windrunner]] [[Squire\|squire]] to Kaladin, gaining the ability to breathe in [[Stormlight\|Stormlight]] and heal wounds, along with limited [[Surgebinding\|Surgebinding]] abilities when Kaladin was nearby. Yake presumably swears at least the [[Immortal Words\|Second Ideal]] of the Windrunners at some point; by 1175 all of the original Bridge Four members have reached that level or higher, except [[Rlain\|Rlain]] and [[Dabbid\|Dabbid]].

## History
Yake was already in the [[Sadeas\|Sadeas]] [[Bridge crew\|bridge crews]] when [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] arrived to the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] in 1173. The reason he was a bridgeman is unknown. He participated in the first bridge run actively led by Kaladin, and was among the last to arrive for duty, along with [[Dunny\|Dunny]] and [[Malop\|Malop]]. After [[Gaz\|Gaz]] put Bridge Four on chasm duty, Yake took notice of the growing camaraderie among the group but was reluctant to join their conversations. Weeks later, he was hit in the arm by an enemy arrow during a bridge run, leaving Bridge Four with only twenty-eight capable members.
When [[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] was training Bridge Four how to fight with the spear, Yake and [[Hobber\|Hobber]] struggled with their thrusts; Kaladin asked [[Moash\|Moash]] to work with them.
Yake, Moash, and [[Teft\|Teft]] were selected by Kaladin to train with [[Zahel\|Zahel]] and [[Ivis\|Ivis]], learning how to deal with [[Shardblade\|Shardblades]] and use [[Stances\|stances]]. Zahel chided Yake for picking up one of his colored stones. Yake briefly wielded a Blade, and was awestruck by it. He also practiced dodging blows from a Blade. He found Ivis attractive even though she was [[Lighteyes\|lighteyed]], unlike Kaladin.
After becoming one of Kaladin's [[Squire\|squires]], he greeted [[Rlain\|Rlain]] during a training session and suggested that he should educate the new recruits in how to hold a spear. He and [[Eth\|Eth]] asked Rlain about the [[Fused\|Fused]] attacking caravans, making the common error of lumping the [[Listeners\|listeners]] in with other [[Singers\|singers]].

## Trivia
Yake is a cameo for an unknown friend or family member of Brandon's.
