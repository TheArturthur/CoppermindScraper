**Silajana** is one of the primal [[Aether\|aethers]] from [[Dhatri\|Dhatri]]. Like all aethers he predates the [[Shattering\|Shattering]], though the aethers' religious followers argue they even predate [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]]. He was eager to assist the [[Ghostbloods\|Ghostbloods]] in their mission to prevent [[Autonomy\|Autonomy]] from taking over [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]], but also seemed reluctant to simply kill soldiers of the [[Set\|Set]] and asked his aetherbound to offer them surrender.
