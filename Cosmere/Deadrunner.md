## Culture
Piracy is a common and accepted part of sea travel on Lumar, and in the [[Emerald Sea\|Emerald Sea]] the **King's Marshals** keep records of all known pirates. However, unlike regular pirates, If you are known as a **Deadrunner** and are caught or captured by the kings sailors, you will likely be hanged, rather than simply imprisoned as a regular pirate would be. It is possible for deadrunners to remain unknown and avoid discovery if they leave no survivors from their attacks, to spread news of their existence.
Pirate crews will often trade, sell or bargain crew members from other ships in order to augment their crews, as in the case of [[Captain Crow\|Captain Crow]] bargaining to get [[Hoid\|Hoid]] on her ship, however; it is common knowledge that no one will accept a crew from a deadrunner ship. [[Ann\|Ann]] notes that there is no mercy shown to deadrunner crews, and in fact, even other pirates will hate you.
There is little hope of pardon if you are a deadrunner. Only the [[Verdant King\|Verdant King]] can grant one, and only extreme cases, such as a [[King's Mask\|King's Mask]] vouching for the crew would be considered enough to make the king enact a pardon. It is highly likely that the crew of the *Two Cups* (formerly *Crow's Song*) is the only deadrunner crew to ever be pardoned.

>“*Then you become a deadrunner, no mercy for you if caught. Even other pirates will hate you.*”
\-Ann[1]


Captain [[Crow\|Crow]] notes that deadrunners generally live lives of opulence, but only in frenzied outbursts. And as most deadrunner lives are bound to be short, that opulence should be enjoyed quickly. She also believes that being a deadrunner is synonymous with being one step away from death.

## Crew of *Crow's Song*
The crew of the *Crow's Song* made the decision to leave behind the life of a successful merchant vessel and crew, and instead follow [[Captain Crow\|Captain Crow]] into a life of piracy, they had no intention of becoming deadrunners. This title was forced upon them when Captain Crow and [[Laggart\|Laggart]] tricked all of them during the attack on the *Oot's Dream*. Instead of using standard cannonballs that explode on impact, they instead used cannonballs that exploded after they pierced the side of the ship, releasing their water inside the ship, rather than on the side. This caused the Verdent spores to explode inside the ship and on the crew of the *Oot's Dream*, effectively sinking the ship and killing the crew.
