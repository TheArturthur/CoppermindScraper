The **Sea of Yomend**, formerly known as the **Southern Sea**, is a body of water on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. It comprises most of the area between the former [[Southern Dominance\|Southern Dominance]] and the [[Southern Islands\|Southern Islands]]. It is connected to the [[Sea of Lennes\|Sea of Lennes]].
In the [[Classical Scadrial\|Classical era]], the [[Bennet\|Bennet]] people lived on the Southern Islands and were known to be excellent seafarers, but little else is known of their society. During the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]], there were some settlements on the northeastern shores of the Southern Sea, near the mouth of the [[River Channerel\|River Channerel]] and the ashmount [[Doriel (ashmount)\|Doriel]].
After the [[Catacendre\|Catacendre]], the sea was renamed to the Sea of Yomend, presumably after [[Aradan Yomen\|Aradan Yomen]]. Two of the most important ports on Scadrial, [[Elendel\|Elendel]] and [[Bilming\|Bilming]], are situated on the Sea of Yomend. The prominent [[Irongate River\|Irongate River]] flows through [[Hammondar Bay\|Hammondar Bay]] into the sea.
