This article's title is uncanonical and a fan created one, because an official term or name has not been made yet.
**Vivenna's mother** is the queen of [[Idris\|Idris]] on [[Nalthis\|Nalthis]] approximately 300 years after the [[Manywar\|Manywar]].

## History
Vivenna's mother married [[Dedelin\|Dedelin]] and had three daughters: [[Vivenna\|Vivenna]], [[Fafen\|Fafen]], [[Sisirinah\|Sisirinah]], and one son [[Ridger\|Ridger]]. She taught her daughters propriety, specifically teaching Siri that it was unseemly to stare at young men. Her older daughters especially felt that their mother supervised their lives and taught them to be controlled. She died over a decade prior to the [[Pahn Kahl rebellion\|Pahn Kahl rebellion]] in a riding accident.

## Legacy
Vivenna, who keeps herself under control at all times largely because of her mother's influence, reminds Dedelin very strongly of his late wife. This is a major factor in his decision not to send Vivenna to [[Hallandren\|Hallandren]], even though he doesn't admit this reasoning to himself. Both of them are unpleasantly reminded of Vivenna's mother's death when they see Siri out taking rides on horseback; this leads to a lot of tension in their relationships, which Siri doesn't understand because she doesn't remember her mother's death.
