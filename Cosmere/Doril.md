Underfen **Doril** is a female [[Sand mastery\|sand master]] on [[Taldain\|Taldain]]. Her rank indicates that she is weak in sand mastery, and she appears to have been a cook for the [[Diem\|Diem]].
She was an older woman with gray hair, and she was seen wearing an apron over her robes. She approached Lord Mastrell [[Kenton\|Kenton]] asking when the next shipment of [[Zaidon\|zaidon]] would arrive. She was one of several people who interrupted Kenton with relatively mundane questions, which led [[Khriss\|Khriss]] to suggest that he delegate some of his duties to [[Elorin\|Elorin]] and [[Dirin\|Dirin]].
