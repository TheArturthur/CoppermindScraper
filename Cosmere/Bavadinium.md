## Properties
Trellium is a silvery metal with a red cast to it, and dark red spots similar to rust. Like other God Metals, it displays many unusual properties. It is notable for repelling other forms of [[Investiture\|Investiture]], with a force proportional to how close it is to the source of Investiture. This causes it to try and roll away when in the proximity of harmonium, Hemalurgic spikes or an Allomancer burning metals.

### Chemical Properties
The hardness of the metal is just above a nine, as it is scratched by diamond, but barely marks corundum. It is also very brittle. It has an extraordinarily high melting point, above 3,000 degrees. When heated, it lets off the full visual spectrum of light (i.e. it appears perfectly white), with the red portion of the spectrum going off the spectrometric scale.

### Interactions with Harmonium
When an electric current is passed through [[Harmonium\|harmonium]], the metal softens and its Investiture begins to polarize, becoming more atium-like on one end and more lerasium-like on the other. If trellium is inserted between the two poles, a violent reaction occurs, as some of the harmonium's Investiture or matter is converted into pure energy. While this technique fails to divide the harmonium, the resultant blast is extremely powerful; converting less than half a gram of harmonium into energy is capable of destroying a thick safe and the fortified room around it. This interaction can be used to create powerful bombs; however, as these weapons rely upon a novel energy release mechanism, not even Autonomy or [[Harmony\|Harmony]] fully understand their true destructive potential.
A separate interaction, detonating harmonium against trellium, produces small amounts of [[Lerasium\|lerasium]] and [[Atium\|atium]]. Harmony uses this effect to manufacture atium.

## Allomantic Use
When burned by an Allomancer, trellium has unknown properties.

## Feruchemical Use
When used by a Feruchemist, trellium has unknown properties.

## Hemalurgic Use
Trellium can steal Allomantic and Feruchemical abilities and grant them to kandra. Presumably its Hemalurgic ability is similar to that of [[Atium\|atium]], allowing the transfer of any ability with somewhat variable success depending on the binding point. Using it as a [[Hemalurgy\|Hemalurgic]] spike can keep the user hidden from [[Harmony\|Harmony]]. This has a limited effect, however, and any more than a single spike will make the user visible to the Shard. It is an inherent property of the metal, and not a Hemalurgic attribute, that hides the user.
Using trellium as a spike allows users to communicate with others. They can speak to others who have a Hemalurgic spike, but they cannot hear their thoughts. They can also create a Connection with Autonomy's avatars, allowing them to communicate and feel each other's presence. Some individuals spiked with trellium exhibit glowing red eyes at times. This behavior is inconsistent; [[Granks\|Granks's]] eyes start faintly glowing during his fight with Marasi, then the glow becomes vivid when he is near death. The glow fades once Marasi removes his trellium spike and he dies. Furthermore, Autonomy herself can act and speak through an individual spiked by a trellium spike.

### Hemalurgic Constructs
[[Hemalurgic chimera\|Hemalurgic chimeras]] are created when a living human is implanted with a trellium spike in a specific manner.

## Trivia
In the *Alloy of Law: Masks of the Past* adventure game supplement, trellium allows kandra to use the Allomantic or Feruchemical abilities of another Hemalurgic spike they are spiked with. They also cannot be controlled by Harmony or brass Allomancy, but they also lose the non-sapience half of their blessing.
