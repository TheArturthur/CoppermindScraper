## Geography
### Territories and Features
#### Territories and borders
Rishir lies in the north and eastern part of [[Roshar\|Roshar]], stretching from [[Kurth\|Kurth]] in the west to [[Akak\|Akak]] in the east. To the east and southeast, it borders [[Alethela\|Alethela]] while to the north, it borders the [[Steamwater Ocean\|Steamwater Ocean]] and the [[Northern Depths\|Northern Depths]]. It also borders the kingdom of [[Valhav\|Valhav]] in the south and contains a number of islands close to [[Sela Tales\|Sela Tales]]. The capital city of Kurth, and the surrounding islands, are located very close to [[Iri\|Iri]]. Rishir controls most of the islands in the Reshi sea.

#### Geographic Features
Most of Rishir lies on or in the [[Reshi Sea\|Reshi Sea]], a large island rich sea in the north of the continent. They control most of the islands in this sea. Rishir has a couple of large and noteworthy rivers running through it, with all of them located on the mainland. The kingdom has no mountain ranges of note.

## Culture
#### Writing and language
It can reasonably be assumed that the people of Rishir spoke multiple languages, including distant ancestors of modern day Herdazian and Reshi. The ancestor language of Herdazian belonged to the [[Vorin\|Vorin]] language family, which also contains the languages of the Alethi, the Thaylen, the Natan, and the Veden peoples. The men living on the [[Reshi Isles\|Reshi Isles]] spoke a different language, which likely belonged to the Iriali language family.
The people of Rishir wrote in the [[Dawnchant\|Dawnchant]]. After a while, they adapted the original Dawnchant script to fit their own languages and developed their own script. This process began with simple phonetic substitution, in which they used the Dawnchant to transcribe their own languages.

## History
### Creation of Roshar
The land that would become known as Rishir was created at an unknown point before the [[Shattering\|Shattering]] by [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]], along with the rest of Roshar and the Rosharan supercontinent over ten-thousand years prior to Vorin year 1174. It is unclear how much the geography of Rishir has changed compared to the land at creation.

### Pre-Human Arrival
Before humanity arrived on Roshar from Ashyn, the land that would come to be known as Rishir was inhabited by [[Singers\|Singers]].
Circa -5825 in the Vorin calendar, humanity arrived on Roshar after fleeing Ashyn and were granted the land that would become [[Shin Kak Nish\|Shin Kak Nish]]. After less than a generation, they headed an invasion, slaughtering some of the Singers and expelling them from their land, claiming it as their own, this included the land that would come to be known as Rishir. This history was lost to man until the discovery of the [[Eila Stele\|Eila Stele]].

### The Establishment of Rishir
  Map of the Silver Kingdoms
Rishir was founded in the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]] Epoch. Due to the Desolations, the people of Rishir were constantly returned back to early technological levels, often to the point of having to make use of stone tools. Though they advanced each time with the help of the Heralds whenever they returned, often receiving this assistance from [[Kalak\|Kalak]] and his [[Willshapers\|Willshapers]]. Old manuscripts and texts dating back to these times mention quick-spreading diseases in the east that killed tens of thousands, and it is likely that at least some of these diseases spread to Rishir.
Very early in the nation's history, the city of [[Kurth\|Kurth]], was created and made into its capital. Kurth was eventually made into the home of the Rishir Oathgate.

#### Further Desolations
The Sixth Epoch lasted at least thirty-one years, and likely significantly longer, before its Desolation arrived.
One of the many Desolations that struck the nation, along with the rest of Roshar, arrived in the year 337 of the Eighth Epoch. This Desolation was heralded by the release of [[Midnight Essence\|Midnight Essence]] in a small settlement in [[Natanatan\|Natanatan]]. The length of this Desolation is unknown.
Another Desolation occurred later and ended circa -3333, during an unknown Epoch. This left society wounded and weak, forcing them into a period of recovery.

#### The Last Desolation (c.-3332)
The Last Desolation was a large scale Desolation which occurred circa -3332, around 4500 years before the [[True Desolation\|True Desolation]]. This Desolation was particularly devasting due to the fact that it happened only a year after the previous Desolation, and thus society was weakened and still recovering. Tired of the Desolations and their torture on Braize, the nine Heralds still on Roshar refused to return to Braize, leaving Taln as the sole Herald on the planet for millennia.
After the Last Desolation, Desolations ceased to ravage the nation. Due to this, society was able to advance much further than ever before, giving them the strength to potentially resist any potential Desolation without complete societal collapse. The era heralded by the Last Desolation came to be known as the Era of Solitude.

#### After Aharietiam
At some unknown point in history, after Aharietiam, Rishir collapsed. 4500 years after the Last Desolation, the area that was ruled by Rishir had fractured into many kingdoms and tribes. Foremost among these kingdoms is the kingdom of [[Herdaz\|Herdaz]], but Kurth, the capital, was taken over by [[Rira\|Rira]] and the Reshi isles declared themselves independent, with each island being ruled over by a different king.
