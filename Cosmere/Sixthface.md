**Sixthface** is one of the six Faces of the cube, a magical world that is shaped like a cube rather than a sphere. It shares Borders with Drakeface and [[Dawnface\|Dawnface]]. There are a number of nations on Sixthface, including Kalvonia and Tarseldia. One language spoken on Sixthface is Lukarvian.
The cube is saturated with magic, and as a result the people of the cube are born with innate magic, the manifestation of which depends on the Face where they were born. Sixthfacers are born with [[Knack\|knacks]], which are usually small, simple talents.
