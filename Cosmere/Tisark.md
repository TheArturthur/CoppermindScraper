The **Tisark** seems to be a group of [[Odium\|Odium's]] followers sent to secure the [[Thaylen City\|Thaylen City]] [[Oathgate\|Oathgate]] during the [[Battle of Thaylen Field\|Battle of Thaylen Field]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].
[[Renarin\|Renarin]] later sees a group of [[Fused\|Fused]] holding the Oathgate; it is possible that Tisark is the name for a particular faction of the Fused.
