**Knighthawk Foundry**, operated by [[Dean Knighthawk\|Dean Knighthawk]], is a post-Calamity technology business, and one of the only ones remaining that operate autonomously of any [[Epic\|Epic's]] regime. Its headquarters are located in the Shewbrent Castle in West Virginia, though it has been known to make temporary portable bases.
The Knighthawk Foundry supplied the [[Reckoners\|Reckoners]], [[Newcago\|Newcago]], and others with mobile phones that could work underground and other technologies. [[Steelheart\|Steelheart]] brokered a deal with Knighthawk to supply the citizens of Newcago with mobiles, but residents of other cities often did not have the resources to have mobiles. Knighthawk is generally regarded as a safe, trustworthy mobile network, but in fact, Dean is able to read and write any message on his phones.
The Knighthawk Foundry also experimented and developed other [[Epic-based technology\|Epic-based technologies]], using Epic DNA harvested by the Reckoners. One of the devices they developed is the [[Spyril\|spyril]].
