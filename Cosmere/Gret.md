## History
### Diggen's Point and Tress' Escape
Gret, like most residents of [[Diggen's Point\|Diggen's Point]], lived on The Rock for most of her life. Similar to those that lived there with her, she was not allowed to leave.
She took part in the plan to help [[Tress\|Tress]] escape aboard the *[[Oot's Dream\|Oot's Dream]]* by hiding herself in an ale barrel full of feathers to muffle her breathing, and hide her from the [[Inspector\|Inspector]]. She was discovered by the Inspector and told that her betrayal would be reported to the [[Verdant King\|Verdant King]]. However, she; along with [[Brick\|Brick]], [[Gremmy\|Gremmy]] and her father [[Sor\|Sor]] knew this to be a ruse, for the inspector, was actually Tress in disguise. By the time Tress has board the *Oot's Dream* and sailed off, she has quietly slipped away. The only people to know of her involvement were Tress, Gremmy, Brick and her father.

### Tress Return
Tress returned to Diggen's Point, as captain of the *[[Two Cups\|Two Cups]]* but only for a short time, long enough to deliver the King's new instructions, along with several other letters, and retrieve her family. During her return, she took special care to thank Gremmy, Brick, Gret, and Sor for their assistance in helping her initially escape The Rock.
