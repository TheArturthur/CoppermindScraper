## Appearance and Personality
He is a wiry man in his early forties. He often wears camouflage. He is from the South, although his family hails from Scotland. He has never been to Scotland, but uses Scottish slang and terminology anyway, despite having a definite Southern accent.
He is fond of making absurd claims about topics such as his own past accomplishments, Scottish culture and history, and the "wee daemons" who allegedly power mobile phones and other technology. The extent to which he believes his own stories is ambiguous, although [[Jonathan Phaedrus\|Prof]] suspects that he only does it to see how people will react. He also adds other commentaries on the Irish and Australian cultures, but not as often as the Scottish mythology. He incorporates these cultures into corrupted sayings such as "everything went to Wales in a handbasket" and "you can bet your kilt on that."

## Attributes and Abilities
Cody does not have one specific role within the Reckoners; he does odd jobs, including welding and scouting. He is good at using the tensors and is an excellent marksman, able to snipe a person at a range of a thousand yards.

## History
Cody was a policeman in Nashville before it was annexed by the [[Coven\|Coven]]. He became a [[Reckoners\|Reckoner]] and was part of [[Jonathan Phaedrus\|Jonathan Phaedrus']] team in [[Newcago\|Newcago]] when [[David Charleston\|David Charleston]] joined the group. He remained behind in Newcago when Prof, [[Tia\|Tia]], and David traveled to [[Babilar\|Babilar]] to face [[Regalia\|Regalia]], but after Prof fell to his powers, he and [[Abraham\|Abraham]] joined David's team. They infiltrated [[Knighthawk Foundry\|Knighthawk Foundry]], which subsequently led the group to [[Ildithia\|Ildithia]] and a confrontation with Prof.

## Trivia
Sanderson's inspiration for Cody's habit of making up stories about his various ancestral cultures came from a conversation he had with a fan from the Southern United States regarding the correct use of "y'all." This fan told Sanderson that "y'all" is commonly used when addressing only one person, which contradicted what Sanderson had heard previously and led him to wonder if the fan was pulling his leg.
In the rulebook for the [[The Reckoners (board game)\|Reckoners board game]], Cody's surname is given as Arlington.
