**Winterwort** is a type of plant native to [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. It is used by surgeons as a soporific anesthetic.
Winterwort can be used to prepare a patient for surgery. It is ingestible after being crushed to a powder and mixed with oil, although it has a bitter taste. At one spoonful per ten brickweight of the patient, it will keep a person unconscious for around five hours.
[[Kaladin\|Kaladin]] and [[Lirin\|Lirin]] used winterwort on [[Sani\|Sani]] when they attempted to repair her crushed hand.
