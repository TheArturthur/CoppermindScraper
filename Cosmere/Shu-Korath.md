**Shu-Korath** is a sect of [[Shu-Keseg\|Shu-Keseg]] that is centered in the [[Sel\|Selish]] nation of [[Teod\|Teod]]. While once more widespread, it is now officially practiced only by the people in the nations of Teod and [[Arelon\|Arelon]]. Shu-Korath is regarded as a docile and unassuming faith, practiced in chapels designed to make its patrons feel comfortable.

## Beliefs
The Korathi worship a merciful, loving god known as Domi, often referred to as “Merciful Domi.” The central tenet of the faith is the **unifying power of love. **




All people’s personalities are gifts to be enjoyed
Unity can spring from strife
Aid should be provided to those who are less fortunate
## Religious Texts & Iconography
Korathi scriptures are contained in the **Do-Korath**.
The official symbol of the Korathi church is **Aon Omi**, which means “love.”

## Organization & Hierarchy
The Korathi church is led by the **patriarch**, a title that is currently held by [[Seinalan\|Seinalan]]. Chapels are led by priests, with “head priests” designated in each city. Additionally, an unspecified group of leaders is responsible for electing a new patriarch when necessary and presumably takes charge of interpreting and safeguarding church doctrine.

## Origins & History
### Split from Shu-Keseg
Shu-Korath developed when one of Keseg’s students, Korath, set out from [[JinDo\|JinDo]] to spread Shu-Keseg’s central tenet of unity of all mankind, teaching that it should be achieved through love. These teachings were later used as the basis for the new faction of Shu-Keseg, named Shu-Korath after its founder.

### Establishment in Arelon and Teod
Korath traveled to the nation of Arelon, whose people worshipped the Elantrians, living gods who resided within its borders. Secure in their own divinity, the pre-Reod Elantrians allowed other religions to preach within their nation, even within the city of [[Elantris (city)\|Elantris]] itself. However, the religion didn’t gain a significant following in Arelon until after the Reod, when the Arelene rejected Elantrian divinity based on the Elantrians’ perceived “disease” or “curse.”
Following Korath’s death, his follower [[ShanVen\|ShanVen]] moved the center of the religion’s operations to Teod, whose monarchy adopted Shu-Korath as the country’s official religion.

### Elantrian Influence & Intersections
Prior to the Reod, Elantrian culture influenced the symbology and practices of the religion that later became known as Shu-Korath.







### Conflict with Shu-Dereth
Though Shu-Korath and Shu-Dereth have differing views on how to achieve their parent religion’s goal of unity, true conflict did not occur until Fjorden adopted Shu-Dereth as an excuse to conquer nearby nations under the guise of divine unification. This reduced the number of countries whose official religion is Shu-Korath, though citizens of those countries may continue to practice Shu-Korath despite its government’s declaration in favor of Shu-Dereth.
