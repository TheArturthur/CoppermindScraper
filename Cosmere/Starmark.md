>“*The more I study sand mastery, the more I see connections to the Starcarved of Darkside. The sun invests some kind of power into the lichen on the sand, similar to how the particulate cloud sends out a weekly pulse that invests power into our starmarks, even if only some few chosen seem to be able to access that power.*”

A **starmark** is a manifestation of [[Investiture\|Investiture]] on the Darkside of [[Taldain\|Taldain]]. Those who use this system are called **Starcarved**. Starmarks are highly connected to [[Sand mastery\|sand mastery]].

## Prerequisites
It is unknown how someone gains starmarks, but only a few are able to access the power. Those who gain the power must first be shown by another Starcarved, possibly in a testing process similar to how the Diem finds acolents that have the ability to master sand.

## Mechanics
The magic primarily functions through tattoos and its effects are not nearly as noticeable as [[Sand mastery\|sand mastery]], although with current information the latter may no longer be true. Starcarved are charged by weekly pulses of light and Investiture from [[Taldain system\|Ridos]]. There are several different colors of Starmark. Some applications of starmarks allow the starcarved to make razor sharp blades or create a shield that can withstand bullets.
Starmarks do not work and are not visible on Dayside.

## Trivia
Starmarks may be a type of tattoo, possibly using ink only visible under UV since they cannot be seen while on Dayside.
