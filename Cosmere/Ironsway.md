**Ironsway** is a town in [[Bavland\|Bavland]] on [[Roshar\|Roshar]].

## Geography
Ironsway lies in Bavland, an autonomous region at the base of a mountain range that is technically within the borders of southwestern [[Jah Keved\|Jah Keved]]. Ironsway features a town square, several hundred homes, and three taverns, making it one of the largest settlements in Bavland. [[Szeth\|Szeth]] still considers it a "village", one of many in Bavland that have a large population of transient workers due to fluctuations in the local mining industry. It is not known what is mined nearby, but the name of the town implies that it may be iron ore.

## History
[[Took\|Took]] brings Szeth to a dingy tavern in Ironsway and shows him off to some fellow mineworkers, including [[Amark\|Amark]] and [[Ton (Veden)\|Ton]]. After Took exits the bar, he heads towards the poor district of Ironsway, since he is too cheap to pay for nicer quarters. Took is killed in the street by a group of thieves who subsequently find and claim Szeth's [[Oathstone\|Oathstone]].
