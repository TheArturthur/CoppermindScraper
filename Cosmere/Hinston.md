**Hinston Ladrian** is the son of [[Edwarn Ladrian\|Edwarn Ladrian]] and the heir to [[House Ladrian\|House Ladrian]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. He is a cousin to [[Waxillium\|Waxillium]] and [[Telsin Ladrian\|Telsin Ladrian]].

## History
Hinston was born to Edwarn and his wife when Wax was eighteen. Before this, having no other children, Edwarn had already started training Wax and Telsin to be the heir of House Ladrian. He was supposed to assume the role as the head of House Ladrian when his father faked his own death, but he caught a disease and died prematurely. Edwarn's plans were already in action, so he was forced to name Wax his successor as the new head of the house and hope that Wax would be useful.
Hinston's death was used as an excuse for why Edwarn, his wife, and Telsin were going for a carriage ride in the [[Outer Estates\|Outer Estates]]. It was supposedly going to be a trip to take their minds off of their grief.
