The [[Bennet\|Bennet]] used to live on the Southern Islands. They were a highly developed people and were famous for being brave seafarers and brilliant cartographers. Some of the maps the Final Empire used were developed by Bennet explorers. Their belief was the [[Truths of the Bennet\|Truths of the Bennet]].
They have an unnamed mountain range running down their length.
