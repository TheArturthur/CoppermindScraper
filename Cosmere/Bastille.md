## Appearance and Personality
 
Para more images, ver .
Bastille has long silver hair and typically wears  and a glassweave uniform. [[Alcatraz\|Alcatraz]] notes that her hair is naturally red, like that of her father and elder brother.
Bastille is short-tempered and rather prone to violence. She tends to act as the voice of reason because she spends most of her time surrounded by reckless Smedrys, but she has her fair share of impulsivity and is extremely brave. She is also a bit insecure because of her parents' high standards and often doubts her own worth as a Crystin, though she projects an aura of confidence. She dislikes sharing personal information.

## Attributes and Abilities
As a Knight of Crystallia, Bastille has a  which grants her enhanced physical abilities and connects her to the other Crystin. She is trained to fight with a sword and dagger. She can use Warrior's Lenses, and has extensive knowledge of  Lenses.

## History
When she was young, Bastille wanted to be an  and studied different types of Lenses. She eventually accepted that she could not be an Oculator and began training to be a Crystin like her mother. She excelled in her training and completed it at a young age. In a move maneuvered by [[Archedis\|Archedis]], she was assigned as [[Leavenworth Smedry\|Leavenworth Smedry]]’s personal Knight, because Archedis wanted a greater chance of Grandpa Smedry dying.

### Foray into the Hushlands
>“*Another Smedry? I have to protect four of you now?*”
\-Bastille upon meeting Alcatraz[3]


When Grandpa Smedry rescued Alcatraz and planned a raid on the local library, Bastille was annoyed that she had to protect an extra Smedry, and that Grandpa Smedry had planned a dangerous library infiltration without informing her. She drove Alcatraz to the library while he filled her in on the mission. Bastille used her knowledge of Oculatory Lenses to help Alcatraz take a read of the library, but evaded Alcatraz’s questions about how she knew so much it. After [[Sing Sing Smedry\|Sing Sing Smedry]] made a distraction, they slipped into the library. Bastille went with Alcatraz and Sing to try and find the Lenses of Rashid. During their search, Bastille explained a lot about the real world to Alcatraz, informing him of the depth of the Librarian lies. They came across A Dark Oculator, Radrian Blackburn, who knocked them out with one of his Lenses.

>“*I can’t believe how stupid I am! I should have realized Alcatraz would have an aura. It was so obvious! I was sloppy. I just… have trouble thinking of that idiot as an Oculator.*”
\-Bastille annoyed with herself after getting captured[12]

They were thrown into a dungeon, and Grandpa Smedry and Quentin were captured to be tortured. Bastille was angry with herself, accepting the blame for being captured. After Alcatraz made his prison guard angry to try and trick him, Bastille grabbed the guard and knocked him out, then freed them. On their way to free Grandpa Smedry and Quentin, they fought an Alivened, Bastille fighting one bravely. In the battle, Alcatraz broke her Crystin sword with his Talent. Bastille and the others distracted Blackburn and freed Grandpa and Quentin. Blackburn followed them, and dueled with Grandpa Smedry. When Blackburn won, Librarian thugs took Bastille captive, though she fought valiantly against them using only a crystal dagger. When Alcatraz tricked Blackburn and blinded him, the thugs holding Bastille captive fled, and Bastille resisted the urge to chase them down. They subsequently caused more chaos and Bastille escaped the library with the others.

## Relationships
>“*I'll have you know that I'm quite good at hugging, despite what you might think. A hug is just a type of grappling move where you don't try to leave the other person dead.*”
\-Bastille[16]


### Alcatraz Smedry
Bastille initially envied [[Alcatraz\|Alcatraz]] for his Oculator powers, was exasperated by his Smedry nature, and disparaged his lack of knowledge of Free Kingdoms culture and technology. However, as they adventured together, they developed a friendship and then a mutual crush, which Bastille admitted to during the battle for Mokia. She expressed her affection for him largely the same way she had expressed her jealousy: physical and verbal violence.
As the narrator of *Bastille versus the Evil Librarians*, she repeatedly denies being romantically affected by Alcatraz's smile and physical closeness (at that time), but she admits to concern for his well-being.
By the time Alcatraz writes *The Dark Talent*, they are married.

### Draulin
>“*I so wanted her to follow her father’s path, not mine. The life of a knight is a lonely one.*”
\-Draulin, observing Bastille unconscious[19]


Bastille shares her intensity, knighthood, and physical prowess with her mother, [[Draulin\|Draulin]]. Both are willing to go to great lengths to save and protect each other, and both are utterly devoted to their knightly oaths to protect the Smedry clan and other Free Kingdom royalty.
However, Bastille rarely feels that her mother approves of her actions. Draulin is harsh by nature, and she does not give compliments lightly.

### Archedis
Bastille was inspired to join the Knights of Crystallia by a skilled and charismatic knight named Archedis. Her adoration for him helped revive her after being disconnected from the Crystin Mind Stone, inspiring jealousy from Alcatraz.
Archedis voted to promote Bastille to a full Knight in order to use her in a plot to get [[Leavenworth Smedry\|Leavenworth Smedry]] killed, but this plot fails. He underestimated Bastille again when he revealed he was a traitor, while all the other Knights were stunned: she defeated him in a duel, her tenacity outmatching his skill.

## Trivia
Her name is a reference to the  fortress in France being used as a prison.
