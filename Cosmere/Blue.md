**Blue** is a guard at a pub in [[Elendel\|Elendel]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. It is unclear whether Blue is his actual name or a nickname that [[Wayne\|Wayne]] uses for him.
He wears a cap and overalls as his guard uniform and carries a stick for clubbing rowdy customers. While on duty, Blue is a straightforward man; he has had previous experiences with Wayne, and seems to be at least somewhat willing to tolerate his antics.
