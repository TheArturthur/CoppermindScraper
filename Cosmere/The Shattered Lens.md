## Synopsis
Can [[Alcatraz\|Alcatraz]] save a city under siege?
If the island of [[Mokia\|Mokia]] falls, so could the rest of the [[Free Kingdoms\|Free Kingdoms]]--and then the entire world would fall under the sway of the Evil [[Librarian\|Librarians]]. Can Alcatraz save the day once more?
Armed only with a few pairs of glasses, a small supply of exploding teddy bears, and his incredible [[Smedry Talent\|Talent]] for breaking things, Alcatraz is determined to try. All he has to do is defeat an army of giant Librarian robots, a force of regular-sized but extremely evil Librarians, and worst of all: his own mother!

## Summary
For a chapter by chapter summary, see [[The Shattered Lens/Summary\|The Shattered Lens/Summary]].
Alcatraz hears about the [[Librarian\|Librarian's]] [[Siege of Mokia\|siege]] of the city, [[Tuki Tuki\|Tuki Tuki]] and wishes aid to be sent to help. However, the [[Council of Kings\|Council of Kings]] does not wish to get involved there, especially as the king of [[Mokia\|Mokia]], [[Talakimallo\|Talakimallo]] was taken out of the city to a safer location. To get the [[Crystin\|Knights of Crystallia]] to help the people of Mokia, Alcatraz escapes to Mokia as the knights will only go to keep him or other [[House Smedry\|Smedrys]] safe.
Running away from a group of knights who are trying to keep Alcatraz 'safe', he and [[Bastille\|Bastille]] manage to get to a [[Colorfly\|Colorfly]] with [[Kaz\|Kaz's]] help. On the way to Tuki Tuki, the Colorfly is shot down and the gang end up outside the Librarians forces that are attacking the city. Attempting to sneak past the forces at night, Alcatraz's [[Smedry Talent\|Smedry Talent]] accidentally triggers, alerting the Librarians of their presence. After fight many Librarians, the three of them manage to get to the dome protected the city and gain entrance.
Meeting [[Talakimallo\|General Mallo]], Alcatraz gets a run down of how the siege is going poorly for the Mokians. Realizing the General is actually the king, Talakiamallo who never left, Alcatraz convinces him to not surrender to the Librarians and hold out until help can come from the [[Free Kingdoms\|Free Kingdoms]].
Talakimallo is incapacitated during a Librarian attack via tunnels dug into the city, and Alcatraz as the next highest ranking person takes lead of the defense of the city. With [[Leavenworth Smedry\|Grandpa Smedry]] leading forces that will arive in seven hours, Alcatraz comes up with a plan to destroy the robots the Librarians are using to attack the city.
Finding his mother amongst a group of captured Librarians, he questions her about the attack and where the book she stole from the Royal Archives is. Unable to get answers he wants, his earlier plan goes ahead and Bastille is knocked out and taken captive. Alcatraz sends Kaz to inform his grandfather that they must arrive before midnight to save them.
Questioning his mother again, Alcatraz learns his fathers plan is to give Talents to everyone, something he knows will cause chaos and must be stopped. The Librarians make yet another attack on the city, and Alcatraz is captured, however he manages to escape quickly after the arrival of Grandpa Smedry and the Knights of Crystallia who were meant to be hours away. Grandpa Smedry's Talent had triggered, believing he was late and thus the knights arrived in time to save the city.
After commandeering a vessel, Alcatraz rescues Bastille from the Librarians, but the ship is then shot down. Believing he is a failure, Alcatraz engages his Breaking Talent and uses it through a pair of Bestower's Lenses and Bastille's [[Fleshstone\|Fleshstone]]. Falling unconscious from the effort, Alcatraz later awakes to find out that he broke all Librarian weapons, saving the day. He also broke all the Smedry Talents at the same time however. Speaking with his mother who was recaptured after previously escaping, Alcatraz decides to go with her to stop his father.
