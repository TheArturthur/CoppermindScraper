>“*That's it, in the Western Dominance, as you guessed. Somewhere near Chardees?*”
\-Vin discussing the location of the last of the Lord Ruler's storage caches with Elend[1]


**Chardees** was a city in the [[Western Dominance\|Western Dominance]] of the [[Final Empire\|Final Empire]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]] located just north of [[Fadrex City\|Fadrex City]]. It is located in the south of the Dominance, on a river or canal that flows into [[Lake Tyrian\|Lake Tyrian]].
When [[Vin\|Vin]] and [[Elend Venture\|Elend Venture]] were in [[Vetitan\|Vetitan's]] [[Storage cache\|storage cache]], they found a metal map of the Final Empire that showed the location of the last undiscovered cache. The map indicated that the fifth cache was in the Western Dominance, and Vin initially thought the marked location was near Chardees before Elend noted that it was actually at Fadrex City. Although Vin was admittedly less knowledgeable than Elend regarding geography, the close proximity of Chardees and Fadrex City likely explains her initial error.
