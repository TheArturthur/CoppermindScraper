## Appearance and Anatomy
They are lean animals with six appendeges. When they need to move quickly, they leap using four legs, with their two clawed forelegs pulled in close to the body. They have very little carapace on them, which is unusual for a Rosharan animal. Axehinds have some characteristics in common with [[Axehound\|axehounds]], but it is unclear if the two animals are related.

## Behavior and Habitat
Axehinds typically graze on grass in open fields. As prey animals, they are easily startled, and will quickly try to evade potential threats. Their habitat includes northern [[Tashikk\|Tashikk]], but is otherwise unknown.
They are consumed as food by humans.

## Trivia
Like the axehound, the axehind seems to be analogous to (and take part of its name from) an animal not native to Roshar, as "" is a term for a female deer.
