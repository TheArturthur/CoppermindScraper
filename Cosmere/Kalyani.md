She is kind and patient and likes to give hugs. She also may make Indian curries for the other aspects, or encourage them to try them, as [[J.C.\|J.C.]] mentions her making one for them (which he assumes is Chinese food, since it has rice in it).

## History
>“*Is it often going to be like this around you, Mr. Steve? Because I am not very well cut out for this.*”
\-Kalyani to Stephen[4]


Steve created Kalyani after reading through a book on Hebrew syntax, grammar, and vocabulary on the plane to Jerusalem. She came up to first class with him and talked with him. With Kalyani’s assistance, Steve spoke with a flight attendant in Hebrew, helping prove to [[Monica\|Monica]] that he his aspects really are real and give him knowledge. Upon arriving in Jersaulem, Kaylani often wandered a bit, listening in on conversations in Hebrew. She helped Stephen ask questions of a police officer.
When Stephen was captured by members of the Abu Sayyaf, Kalyani and the others presented themselves as being bound with tight ropes. When the men brought in Razon and began beating him, Kalyani felt great sympathy for him and cried. When Monica escaped and a gunfight ensued, Kalyani took cover and cowered for the duration of the fight. At the end of the fight, she worriedly pointed out that one of the men on the ground was not actually dead. This allowed Stephen to see the grenade in the man’s hand and get far enough away to avoid being killed by the blast.
Kalyani took a less active role in Stephen’s later jobs, but stayed close. After asking Stephen multiple times if he can make her husband [[Rahul\|Rahul]] an aspect too, saying that he is a good photographer, he appeared at the mansion where they live. Kalyani befriended one of Stephen’s aspects, [[Ngozi\|Ngozi]], helping her grow more comfortable being outside despite her germophobia. In Stephen’s other jobs, Kalyani often took calls from several other aspects and relayed them to Stephen while he was busy.

## Trivia
Kalyani is named after [[Brandon\|Brandon]]'s good friend Kalyani Poluri, who is a beta reader and assists Brandon with aspects of the [[Cosmere\|cosmere]] that connect to Indian mythology.
