\-The Admiral[1]


The **Admiral** is the commander of the [[Night Brigade\|Night Brigade]]. Her real name is unknown. She snuck onto the surface of [[Canticle\|Canticle]] along her staff sergeant, [[Truth-Is-Waiting\|Truth-Is-Waiting]], in order to search for [[Nomad\|Nomad]], but was unsuccessful in finding him; ultimately, she chose to question the [[Scadrian\|Scadrian]] research ship present on the planet instead of the locals.

## Appearance and Personality
The Admiral is a tall woman, with short black hair and a formal demeanor. She wears a full military uniform, and typically stands when working, disinclined to rest. She is rather hands-on with the Night Brigade operations, descending upon the surface of Canticle herself rather than leaving the matters to her subordinates. While she has no compunction against harming civillians, she prefers to aim her violence at more useful targets. She appears to have a particular focus on acquiring the [[Dawnshard\|Dawnshard]] that Nomad once held; that Nomad keeps slipping her confuses and infuriates her. Although she does not express that fury openly, she prefers to be left alone when incensed.

## Abilities
Aside from commanding the living members of the Night Brigade, the Admiral can also control the Brigade's [[Shade\|shades]]. She can do so without having to vocalize her commands, as the shades seemingly obey her desires. How she accomplishes this is unknown, though it may be tied to the Continuity Chain, the whip-like weapon she always keeps on her person.

## Trivia
The Admiral is set to be the protagonist (though not necessarily the hero) of *The Night Brigade*.
