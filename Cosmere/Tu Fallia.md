## Geography and Ecology
It borders [[Greater Hexi\|Greater Hexi]], [[Triax\|Triax]], [[Emul\|Emul]], and [[Tu Bayla\|Tu Bayla]]. It is on the edge of the [[Tarat Sea\|Tarat Sea]].
The [[Stormfather\|Stormfather]] shows [[Dalinar Kholin\|Dalinar Kholin]] the area around Tu Fallia and [[Triax\|Triax]] in a vision. Dalinar has little experience with Tu Fallia, and describes lush valleys with flora with large green leaves and tightly knoted vines; and fauna with leathery skin and long tentacles for arms, who were able to squeeze into tight pockets under the underbrush to protect themselves from highstorms.
It has an area of around 127,000km, making it the smallest known nation on Roshar. In comparison to real-world nations, it is somewhat larger than Eritrea.

## History
During the [[Silver Kingdoms\|Silver Kingdoms]] era, Tu Fallia was a part of [[Makabakam\|Makabakam]].
[[Urithiru\|Urithiru]] has an underground system of caverns, and there is a stream that leads to an exit in the mountain foothills of Tu Fallia after several days' march. [[Re-Shephir\|Re-Shephir]] was suspected to have fled through this exit after her confrontation with [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]].

## Politics
[[Szeth\|Szeth]] considers Tu Fallia a nomadic backwater similar to [[Hexi\|Hexi]]. It is only nominally a "nation" and it lacks any form of organized government, even compared to the loose tribal coalition of [[Marat\|Marat]].

## Trivia
In comparison to real-world nations, it is somewhat larger than Eritrea.
