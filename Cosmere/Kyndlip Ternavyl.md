\-Kyndlip's comparison between Gave Entrone and a boar[1]


**Kyndlip Ternavyl** is a resident of [[Bilming\|Bilming]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. She is the owner and editor of *[[The Two Seasons\|The Two Seasons]]* broadsheet. She is of [[Terris\|Terris]] heritage, giving her darker skin and kinky hair.
At some point, Kyndlip married and had children. She either started *The Two Seasons* or became its proprietor some years prior to the [[Set\|Set's]] endeavor to impress [[Autonomy\|Autonomy]]; being sympathetic to [[Elendel\|Elendel]] interests, she sent staff to Elendel on at least one occasion and interviewed [[Marasi Colms\|Marasi Colms]]. In 348 [[Catacendre\|PC]], Kyndlip made a comment unfavorably comparing Bilming's mayor [[Gave Entrone\|Gave Entrone]] to a boar. She was subsequently kidnapped by the Set, taken to the caverns underneath Bilming, and placed with other political dissidents. This prompted her family to search for her, appealing to the mayor himself in their efforts, and to publish a notice about her disappearance in the *Seasons*. While in captivity, Kyndlip took notes on the things she saw and heard. Giving her notebook to Marasi when she, [[Moonlight\|Moonlight]], and [[TwinSoul\|TwinSoul]] discovered and freed the group of captives, Kyndlip urgently warned them about the existence of an army put together by the Set and directed them to find the [[Community\|Community]]. TwinSoul took the group of former captives and guided them back to Bilming. It is likely that Kyndlip later gave evidence against Gave Entrone.
