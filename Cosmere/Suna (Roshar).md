**Suna** is a slave in [[Tvlakv\|Tvlakv's]] caravan.
He's a timid, quiet man, wearing a set of tunic and trousers given to [[Shallan\|Shallan]] by merchants she'd rescued. Rather than being branded, he is, like the rest of Tvlakv's group, tattooed, indicated he's either a child of a slave or someone who willingly entered servitude, perhaps to pay off a debt.
He joins Shallan during her journey towards the [[Shattered Plains\|Shattered Plains]] warcamps. He presumably reaches them with her, as slaves are mentioned carrying her trunk into the [[House Kholin\|Kholin]] camp. If so, he would later become a member of [[Sebarial\|Sebarial's]] manor staff.
