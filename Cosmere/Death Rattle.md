>“*Many cultures speak of the so-called Death Rattles that sometimes overtake people as they die. Tradition ascribes them to the almighty, but I find too many of them to be seemingly prophetic. This will be my most contentious assertion I am sure but I think these are the effects of Moelach persisting in our current times. Proof is easy to provide: the effect is regionalized, and tends to move across Roshar. This is the roving of the Unmade.*”
\-Hessi's Mythica, page 170[1]


**Death Rattles** are a phenomenon related to the [[Unmade\|Unmade]] [[Moelach\|Moelach]]. His presence causes some dying individuals to experience precognitive events in the form of cryptic utterances, in the final moments of life. This effect occurs only in the area around Moelach, who tends to move around [[Roshar\|Roshar]]. Death Rattles were apparently moderately common in [[Shinovar\|Shinovar]] at some time between 1138 and 1166, as [[Szeth\|Szeth]] recounts the phenomenon. The emergence of the Death Rattles in the East appears to coincide with the expedition of King [[Gavilar Kholin\|Gavilar Kholin]] of [[Alethkar\|Alethkar]] where the [[Parshendi\|Parshendi]] were first encountered in 1166. Later, during 1174, Moelach and the Rattles moved to the [[Horneater Peaks\|Horneater Peaks]].

## Uses
King [[Taravangian\|Taravangian]] of [[Kharbranth\|Kharbranth]] keeps a record of Death Rattles taken from selected hospital patients (the terminally ill, the lowly, and the forgotten) who are slowly and intentionally bled to death solely for this purpose by the king's [[Silent Gatherer\|Silent Gatherers]]. He does so in order to supplement the [[Diagram (literature)\|Diagram]], despite the Diagram itself calling Death Rattles and Moelach a distraction. The Diagram is aware of the possibility that Moelach, as Unmade servant of [[Odium\|Odium]] may be feeding them bad information, but they believe the benefits of future sight outweigh the risks. They think the knowledge of what subjects the information contains is useful whether the information is correct or not.
