## Appearance & Personality
Sukishi is a large man with white hair and the complexion of an elderly person. He wears thick trousers and a button-up shirt.

## History
[[Nikaro\|Nikaro]] visited Sukishi's office earlier on the night that the painter first spotted [[Liyun\|a stable nightmare]], to turn in two paintings of [[Nightmare\|nightmares]]. After Nikaro did not report for work the following day, the foreman stopped by Nikaro's apartment, where he met [[Yumi\|Yumi]] and asked her to have the painter report in. Yumi later visited Sukishi's office to report that Nikaro was sick, and he did not believe the story. When Yumi then claimed that Nikaro faced a stable [[Nightmare\|nightmare]], Sukishi assumed it to be a complete fabrication on Nikaro's part and did not report the sighting to the [[Dreamwatch\|Dreamwatch]].
Sukishi eventually had other painters cover Nikaro's territory, after he stopped showing up for work. Later, when the stable nightmare was encountered once more, [[Tojin\|Tojin]] reported to Sukishi, who summoned the Dreamwatch after seeing the damage caused by the creature firsthand.

## Relationships
### Nikaro
Sukishi is aware of the way Nikaro lied about joining the Dreamwatch and skipped his classes, giving him an extremely negative and mistrusting opinion of the painter. He also dislikes the way Nikaro repeatedly uses bamboo to paint nightmares, considering the technique to be lazy. He was surprised by the idea of Nikaro having a woman in his apartment, after meeting Yumi there. Nikaro can sense the man's contempt for him.
