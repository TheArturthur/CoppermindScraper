**Matieu** is captain of the constables in [[Ironstand\|Ironstand]] on [[Scadrial\|Scadrial]]. He is tall and lanky, has a ready smile, and is somewhat in awe of [[Waxillium Ladrian\|Waxillium Ladrian]].
After the [[Nightstreet Gang\|Nightstreet Gang]] attacked a train near Ironstand in 342 [[Catacendre\|PC]], Matieu and his constables took the remaining bandits into custody. Matieu instructed his constables to give Wax some space, then inquired if any of the servants besides [[Drewton\|Drewton]] would be needing emotional support. As Wax searched the train for [[Wayne\|Wayne]] and [[MeLaan\|MeLaan]], Matieu followed him and gave him details on the gang. He planned on chasing the criminals, whom he expected to be making for the [[Roughs\|Roughs]], and asked Waxillium to join the posse. Getting no certain answer from Wax, he saluted and retreated.
