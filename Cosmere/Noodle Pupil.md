## History
The Noodle Pupil was founded by [[Design\|Design]], a [[Cryptic\|Cryptic]] from [[Roshar\|Roshar]] who bonded with [[Hoid\|Hoid]]. After arriving on the planet, Hoid froze in time due to protections he put on himself to stop his memories from being tampered with again. Design started the shop with help from the assistant cook [[Namakudo\|Namakudo]], and attracted lots of nightmare painters who would visit after hours or during breaks. Once Hoid was unfrozen, Design willed the shop's ownership to Yumi and Painter, who later renamed it the 'Noodle Princess.'
