**Skai** was the original [[Vessel\|Vessel]] of the [[Shard\|Shard]] [[Dominion\|Dominion]]. Sometime after the [[Shattering\|Shattering]], she and [[Aona\|Aona]] took up residence on [[Sel\|Sel]]. [[Edgli\|Edgli]] believes that, by doing so, they violated the original Vessels' pact to not settle on the same world as another Shard, though the exact terms of that agreement are somewhat unclear.

The [[Dor\|Dor]] is a fuels the magics [[AonDor\|AonDor]], [[Dakhor\|Dakhor]], [[ChayShan\|ChayShan]], [[Forgery\|Forgery]], and [[Bloodsealing\|Bloodsealing]].

## History
Nothing is known about Skai's origins and life prior to the [[Shattering\|Shattering]], other than that she came from [[Yolen\|Yolen]]. For unknown reason, she and a group of others broke the [[Cosmere\|cosmere's]] creator deity, [[Adonalsium\|Adonalsium]], into sixteen pieces. Of those sixteen, she took up [[Dominion\|Dominion]], and departed alongside [[Devotion\|Devotion]] for [[Sel\|Sel]].

## Trivia
Although Skai was often assumed to be male in the fandom, Brandon currently plans for Skai's pronouns to be she/her, though that is subject to change until canonized in a book.
