**Shallan's Sketchbook** is a portfolio that [[Shallan Davar\|Shallan Davar]] keeps of her sketches and drawings.
The original is lost during the attack on the *Wind's Pleasure*.
The one about Pattern is wet on the right, and it appears to read, from top down:

It appears to be made up of lines? They’re not exactly tendrils or tentacles, they don’t grasp or reach, they just keep dividing and multiplying and combining into different patterns.
The lines always seem to be connected, either at the central root of the Pattern or by dividing off from a root line, all delicate shapes mix and overlap and reduce by multiple divisions.
It almost seems to phase in and out between two and three-dimensional space. I think it prefers a surface to connect with, but I have seen it move through the air on several occasions.
It certainly presents some veneer of depth, but the Pattern doesn’t appear to possess any consistent dimensions in terms of size.
I am almost certain that I have seen this Pattern somewhere before. It shares some resemblance with the creatures I observed in Kharbranth but without the body and those strange ribes. Is it possibly a doll or [?] of theirs?


## Interior Art
Some of the pages from her portfolio are published in *The Way of Kings*, *Words of Radiance*, *Oathbringer* and *Rhythm of War*.
